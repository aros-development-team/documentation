   builds are not configured to be easily used, are not always stable, and
   they are missing most of the applications essential to a regular user experience.

Nightly Builds
======================

Nightly builds are done, as the name implies, every night, directly
from the Git repository, and they contain the latest code. However,
they have not been tested in any way and may contain bugs. Most of the
time, though, they work just fine. `Download link`__

These builds are based on sources of the new `ABI`__. **They are not
compatible with old AROS distributions/forks.**

Please report bugs you may discover while using these builds through the
`issue tracker`__.

Snapshots
=================

Snapshots are non-periodic, non-automated builds of AROS. They are done
by developers who can't set up a nightly build for some reason.

These ports are not unmaintained, so please use the `issue tracker`__ to report
bugs.
