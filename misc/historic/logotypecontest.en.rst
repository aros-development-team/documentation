AROS needs a new and great-looking logotype to match our mascot__. We need 
your help, so this is your chance to change the face of AROS! We are holding 
a logotype contest where anyone is free to enter. So mail in your logo 
suggestion now to aros-contest@chodorowski.com (note: maximum mail size is

We will hold a public voting for the best logotype once the deadline_ is up. 
All valid contributions will be displayed, and you can vote for your favorite 
logo. Please try to make the logotype match our mascot and the current website
design. It's not a requirement, but it would be appreciated. ;-)
