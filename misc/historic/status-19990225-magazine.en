What is AROS?
=============

Some time back in the year 1993, the situation for the Amiga looked somewhat
worse than usual (doesn't it always?) and some Amiga fans got together and
argued about what should be done to increase the acceptance of our beloved
machine.  Immediately the main reason for the missing success of the Amiga
became clear: it was propagation - or the lack thereof.  The Amiga should get
a more widespread basis to make it more attractive for everyone to use and to
develop for.  So plans were made to reach this goal.  One of the plans was to
fix all bugs of the AmigaOS, another was to make it an OS of the 90s.  AOS was
born.

But what is a bug?  And how should bugs be fixed?  What are the features
a so-called *modern* OS must have?  And how should they be implemented into the
AmigaOS?

Two years later, people were still arguing about this and not even one line of
code had been written (or at least no one had ever seen that code). Discussions
were still of the pattern "we must have ..." and someone answered "read the old
mails" or "this is impossible to do, because ..." which was shortly followed by
"you're wrong because ..." and so on.

In the winter of 1995, I (Aaron Digulla) was fed up with it and I posted an RFC
(request for comments) to the AOS mailing list in which I asked what the minimal
common ground might be.  Several options were given and the conclusion was that
almost everyone would like to see an OS which is compatible to OS 3.1 (Kickstart
40.68) on which further discussions could be based upon to see what is possible
and what is not.

So the work began and AROS was born.


The goals of AROS
=================

AROS' goal is it to create an OS which:

+ Is as compatible as possible to AmigaOS 3.1. If possible, it will be
  compatible to AmigaOS 3.5 as well.

+ Can be ported to different kinds of CPUs, for example Intel x86, PowerPC,
  Alpha, Sparc, HPPA and more and also on the original Amiga.

+ Should be binary compatible on Amiga and source compatible on any other
  hardware.

+ Can run as a standalone version which boots directly from hard disk, as an
  emulation which opens a window on an existing OS to develop software and run
  Amiga and native applications at the same time and as a link library which
  allows to create native applications with the comfort of the AmigaOS. 

The goal for the first final release is to make development easier and faster.
For later versions its possible to increase the compatibility to AmigaOS if its
necessary.

To reach this goal, we use a number of techniques.  First of all, we make heavy
use of the Internet.  You can participate in our project even if you can write
only one single OS function.	The most current version of the source is
accessible 24 hours per day and patches can be merged into it at any time.
A small database with open tasks prevents all developers from doing something
twice.


The current Status
==================

Currently, there are 71 developers registered and a group of about 5 people
commits code regularly. When I write this, the code is about 29MB, about 56%
have been finished and 13% is in work.

We are working hard on finishing graphics, layers and intuition based on our new
HIDD system. The HIDD system will allow us to put any kind of hardware below
AROS with only very little effort for people who want/need/have to write
a driver for a new piece of hardware. This work is mostly done by Nils Henrik
Lorentzen and Stefan Berger. The main goal is to have a version of AROS which
can open a screen, create windows on it and let the use manipulate them.
Currently, X11 is used to create the windows and X11 also allows to manipulate
them. The time-frame for this is May.

Michael Schulz has committed very promising code which can be compiled, saved on
a floppy and then be used to boot a small part of AROS on a bare IBM compatible
PC. When the new graphics system is ready, writing a VGA driver should take
a day (if not less) and AROS should be able to open a workbench screen and
windows on it. No workbench yet, though :-) AROS does already boot but it
doesn't do much, yet.

The next step would be to finish the console.device (half of it is already
finished) and put the input.device on top of the HIDD system. This should
integrate X11 (or whatever is below AROS) nicely into the AROS system allowing
to open a shell on an AROS screen. This will be done by Nils and Johan
Alfredsson, who is also working on the Commodities. This should take about one
month.

When the HIDDs for PC hardware are finished (mostly done by Michael Schulz), it
should be possible to boot AROS from a diskette and use a shell to enter some
commands. An FFS file system also seems at the brink of completion, so creating
an Amiga partition and installing it on the hard disk will then soon be
possible. No time frame has been set for all this, yet. It mainly depends on how
much (correct) information books about PC hardware contain, how the code for
Linux looks like and such.

Branko Collin is meanwhile working on improving the documentation (the web pages
are not exactly ... "sexy" :-), fixing the many typos and writing documentation
about how to write documentation.

Kars de Jong is working on the Linux/m68k port of AROS which allows to run
binary Amiga software. Some simple programs already work. When not working on
Layers, Stefan Berger tries to compile programs from Fish disks and AmiNET work
on AROS.

Bernhard Fastenrath and Aaron Digulla work on merging AROS with UAE which should
allow to make UAE faster and run native Amiga programs in an emulator when AROS
is able to run standalone (that is, without the help of Linux). We will
investigate the necessary steps and do tests during March. At the end of the
month, the next step will be decided.

Przemyslaw Szczygielski and Claus Herrmann are looking at PPC support. The
former for a port to LinuxPPC and the latter for making Exec on the Amiga work
on PPC (thus using the power of the PPC to run Amiga software on an Amiga).
Przemo hopes for some results in May and I must convince Claus to merge his code
with ours :-)

What the future might bring, who knows. The main goals right now are making AROS
work as a standalone system which can boot from a hard disk, writing some
drivers for the HIDD system so we can see if everything really fits to where it
belongs, rewrite the most complex part of the AmigaOS: Intuition, Graphics and
Layers.

The future will hopefully see a commercial version of AROS (so that we can pay
Amiga Inc. some money so they keep calm), a free version of AROS (just like
Linux: free without support or commercial with support), many more HIDDs, a port
of AROS to PPC.

But that doesn't mean that you can sit back, relax and watch our progress (which
is now updated daily on http://www.aros.org/progress.gif). We need you!

Currently, more and more parts of AROS are being finished and we need some
real-world code to test AROS. What code would that be ? Here are the criteria:

+ It must only use pure AmigaOS calls (no MUI or such)
+ No hardware banging or calls to things like MrgCop(), CWait() or the like
  (usually functions which directly relate to some Amiga hardware specific
  feature). Most Blitter-Functions are ok, however.
+ **No assembler code**!
+ It should compile with recent versions of SAS/C, gcc, StormC or another ANSI-C
  compiler.
+ They should be not too big (don't send in 1.5MB of source code, yet).

If you happen to have such a gem, then send it to:

    aros-code@aros.fh-konstanz.de

Please make *absolutely clear* if you mind if your code is published with the
source code of AROS or not. We promise that we won't touch any copyright notices
(except for adding them if they are missing, so you get your credit). It's just
that you might not want that the code is revealed for any reason which would be
ok for us. We just need to know :-)


AROS and Amiga Inc.
===================

What everybody wants to know: What does Amiga Inc. think about AROS or Gateway
2000. I have spoken to Jeff Schindler, Bill McEwen and Petro Tyschtschenko. All
of them have been quite positive about the project but the legal issues involved
are tricky. In Europe, there is no legal way to attack AROS besides using
trademarked names. Outside Europe, algorithms may be patented and since we are
trying to emulate the AmigaOS as close as possible, we probably infringe some
patents and that could make AROS vulnerable.

For now, we have agreed on this: We continue the development and tell everyone
what we are doing but the source code is only accessible by people who register
with us. If you think, you can help and want access to the sources, read the
section about CVS on our WWW pages.

Besides that, we are thinking about ways which would allow us to publish the
source of AROS just like the Linux sources without tripping on Gateways' toes.
