.. Note::

   This document is currently only a draft and as such will most likely change
   before it is accepted as an official specification. It might also be
   deprecated if a better approach has been found in the mean time, and
   doesn't necessarily correspond precisely with the current implementations.


This document describes the inner workings of exec.library. It's not intended
for application programmers but for those who are interested the systems inner
workings. Most of the things described herein are system private - they may or
may not be true for future system versions.

Exec is a shared library giving the ability for multitasking, including
communication between tasks, memory management, shared libraries, and device
I/O. Large parts of this library are formed by a set of functions that are
called on the user's schedule just like any normal C function would be (though
they do things you'd usually expect in a kernel). These functions make up the
library part of exec, with this part being built on a smaller set of functions
which form the core of exec (you may call them the real kernel if you like).
This machine-dependent core serves things like supervisor mode, traps,
interrupts, task exceptions, and context-switching routines.

The core of exec in short:

``ULONG Supervisor(ULONG (*)());``
    Calls a user-function in supervisor mode.

``APTR tc_TrapData;`` and ``APTR tc_TrapCode;``
    User settable trap vector.

``IntVects[i]``
    The different interrupt vectors.

``void Disable(void);``
    Disable interrupts.

``void Enable(void);``
    Enable interrupts.

``BYTE IDNestCnt;``
    ``-1`` if interrupts are allowed.

``APTR PrepareContext(APTR);``
    Prepare a new stack to hold a context.

``void Switch(void);``
    Do a task switch.

``AttnFlags & 0x8000``
    Delayed dispatch flag.

``AttnFlags & 0x80``
    Delayed switch flag.

``tc_Flags & TF_SWITCH``
    tc_Switch is active.

``void (*tc_Switch)();``
    Vector to be called before task loses CPU.

``tc_Flags & TF_LAUNCH``
    ``tc_Launch`` is active.

``void (*tc_Launch)();``
    Vector to be called before task gets CPU.

``UBYTE tc_State;``
    Where the actual task structure is sorted in.

``struct Task *ThisTask;``
    Pointer to actual task structure.

``struct List TaskReady;``
    Sorted list of tasks waiting for CPU.

``tc_Flags & TF_EXCEPT``
    Raise a task exception for this task at the next context switch.

``void Exception(void);``
    Is called to handle the task exception.

The most important part are the context switching routines. The context of
every task is stored on the task's user stack. The stack pointer is stored in
the task structure. Context switches are raised by moving the current task to
one of the two task lists (must be done with interrupts Disable()d) and then
calling Switch(). However, if this happens inside an interrupt (which is
allowed and quite useful) the user context is unavailable. Therefore Switch()
checks if it was called from user mode and sets the delayed dispatch flag if
not. This flag tells the interrupt primitives to do a context switch (by
calling Dispatch()) before falling down to user mode. When called from user
mode Switch() calls Dispatch() directly. Dispatch() is the function which does
the real work, i.e. it replaces the current task with the first task in the
ready list. If the TF_EXCEPT flag for the new task is set, Dispatch() raises
a task exception by calling the Exception() vector of exec with interrupts
Disable()d. Also, tc_Switch and tc_Launch are both handled by Dispatch().

The usual way to do a context switch is as follows::

    if(I_need_a_task_switch)
    {
      /* The task lists must be protected with a Disable() */
      Disable();
      /* check if task switches are allowed */
      if(SysBase->TDNestCnt<0&&SysBase->IDNestCnt<=0)
      {
        /* Check if there is already a pending task switch (this check can
           be skipped if I can guarantee to be in user mode). */
        if(SysBase->ThisTask->tc_State==TS_RUN)
        {
          /* No. Move the current task away */
          Enqueue(new_list,SysBase->ThisTask);
          SysBase->ThisTask->tc_State=new_state;
          /* And do the switch */
          Switch();
        }
      }else
        /* Memorize task switch for a later Enable() or Permit(). */
        SysBase->AttnFlags|=0x80;
      Enable();
    }

Interrupts and traps are delivered with direct function calls. The different
interrupt levels call different interrupt vectors (stored in IntVects[i]).
Traps are raised by calling the tc_TrapCode vector of the current task
(usually this ends up in an Alert() - the exec equivalent of a kernel panic).
Interrupts may be disabled completely (by calling Disable(), Enable() enables
them again, Disable() calls may be nested) but only for a short time.
