   This document is currently only a draft and as such will most likely change

   deprecated if a better approach has been found in the mean time, and
   doesn't necessarily correspond precisely with the current implementations.

Introduction
============

As an application programmer you don't have to worry about the
file system interface -- you can do everything you want via simple calls
to DOS. However you may need to know how to interface with a file system
if you:

+ Need to write your own file system,
+ Wish to do asynchronous I/O,
+ Are writing a console driver,
+ Don't trust DOS.

Of the above the most useful of these would be doing asynchronous I/O,
although it is in many cases better to use one of the publicly available
libraries to do this, as that will hide from you the file systems'
implementation details.




It's completely different
=========================

The interface to the file systems under AROS differs from that under AmigaOS
in many ways:

+ File systems are exec devices, not process' message ports. This gives
  two main benefits -- it is possible to do some work on the callers
  schedule, which for simple requests can save two context switches;
  and it gives us a way to abort a request, which is an important
  feature for a network file system.
+ There is no difference between locks and file handles any more. This
  avoids requiring redundant methods such as `ACTION_FH_FROM_LOCK`.
+ No BCPL -- everything is a C data type or a string. A side effect
  of this is that there is no limit on string size which translates
  to no limit on filename size either.

Obviously this change renders the file system incompatible to the current
AmigaOS file systems and DOS implementation. However it should be possible
to build a bridge between the file systems if necessary.




File system devices
===================

The major API-change of file systems is that they now use the Exec Device
API. You can use the normal device functions (`DoIO()`, `AbortIO()`, etc.).
The I/O Request structure is defined in `dos/file systems.h`::

    /* IORequest from <exec/io.h> */
    struct IORequest
    {
        struct Message  io_Message;
        struct Device  *io_Device;  /* file system base pointer */
        struct Unit    *io_Unit;    /* file or directory handle */
        UWORD           io_Command; /* the command */
        UBYTE           io_Flags;   /* normal device flags (IOF_QUICK) */
        BYTE            io_Error;   /* error code from device functions */
    };

    struct IOFileSys
    {
        struct IORequest IOFS;
        LONG             io_DosError; /* secondary error code (IoErr()) */
        union {}         io_Union;    /* arguments - command dependent */
    };

The `io_DosError` field is used to return the secondary error
code to the caller. This is the code that is returned by the
`dos.library` function `IoErr()`. The `io_Error`field of `struct IORequest`
should only be used to return a simple failure/success for file system
commands, and should have the normal effect for the device open/close
commands.

The `io_Union` field is an union containing different structures for each of
the commands. This field has a variable length depending upon the command. The
fields listed in the "Input" sections of the autodocs below refer to a
specific member of this union.




Command documentation
=====================

OpenDevice()
------------

Name
""""

``OpenDevice("*.handler", 0, iofs, 0);``


Function
""""""""

Mount a new file system. The `IOFileSys` structure passed in `iofs` to the
handler should contain enough information for the handler to mount the
file system.

If a volume is mounted in this device, it's the responsibility of the handler
to add the required volume nodes to the DOS device list before returning to
the caller. Note here, that the DOS device list is already locked, so you do
not need to lock it yourself.

The file system must return a handle to the device in the `io_Unit` pointer of
the `struct IOFileSys`. The `io_Error` and `io_DosError` fields should be set
appropriately for success or failure.


Input
"""""

`iofs`
    The union field `io_OpenDevice` is being used. Fill it with these values:

    `io_DeviceName`
        Name of the exec device to mount the file system upon. This device is
        the underlying hardware of the device. Note that this field may not be
        valid for some special types of handlers (for example network
        file systems or special devices ``AUX:``, ``SER:``).

    `io_Unit`
        Unit number for the exec device. Note this is the
        `io_Union.io_DeviceName.io_Unit` field, not `io_Unit`.

    `io_Environ`
        This is a pointer to the struct DosEnvec which describes this device.


Result
""""""

`io_Device`
    device base pointer.

`io_Unit`
    logical device handle.

`io_Error`
    `IOERR_OPENFAIL` or ``0`` for no error.

`io_DosError`
    DOS error code or ``0`` for no error.

""""""""

+ `CloseDevice()`_



CloseDevice()
-------------

Name
""""

``CloseDevice()``


Function
""""""""

Try to dismount a DOS device. If there are any mounted volumes in the device,
the file system should remove them from the DOS device list. Note that the DOS
device list will have already been locked by the caller, so you will not have
to do this yourself.

You should not dismount the device if there are open files or outstanding
locks remaining.


Input
"""""

`io_Unit`
    logical device handle.


Result
""""""

The DOS device shall be dismounted if possible.

`io_DosError`

Create a handle to an existing file or directory. You can use this
handle to read directories or read/write files.

The filename ``io_Args[0]``
is relative to the path of the directory
associated with the handle `io_Unit`. If
`io_Unit` is `NULL` however,
the filename should be taken as relative to the root directory of
the device.

Try and read the requested number of bytes from the file handle.
A handler will normally try and fulfil the request completely,
but special handlers (such as the console) may return less than
the requested number of bytes.

If you reach the end of the file, you should return the number

return 0 for EOF. Any further attempts to read should result in
a return of -1 with an error code.

This command will wait for a character to be ready for reading. You should
only wait for a maximum of ``io_Timeout`` microseconds. If ``io_Timeout`` is
0, then you should wait indefinitely.

This command can be used on both plain files and interactive files. For plain

however in general, they will only be 16-bit values. If the values are outside
the 16-bit range, and you are unable to handle the values then you can return
an error. The ``ERROR_BAD_NUMBER`` appears to be the most appropriate error
number.

something that is not a file system is a device handler, like PAR:.

This command uses the ``io_Union.io_IS_FILESYSTEM`` member.

--------------

Name
""""

``FSA_MORE_CACHE`` - Add more cache buffers to the file system.


Function
""""""""

Add the number io_NumBuffers of cache buffers to the file system. The size of
the buffer should have been given during the initial file system open.

If the number of buffers is negative, then the result will be to remove
buffers from the device. You can not have less than 0 buffers.

This command uses the ``io_Union.io_MORE_CACHE`` member.


Input
"""""

io_NumBuffers
    The number of buffers to add/remove.


Result
""""""

The number of buffers will have been altered if possible.

io_NumBuffers
    The new number of buffers in the file system. This should be returned,
    even on failure.

io_DosError
    DOS error code, or 0 for success.



FSA_FORMAT
----------

Name

to write its own data.

This command uses the ``io_Union.io_FORMAT`` member.


Input
"""""

io_VolumeName
    the new name for the volume.

io_DosType
    the new type of the volume. This is file system-specific.

    The new mount mode of the file system.

io_Mask
    The mask of flags to change in the mount mode.
