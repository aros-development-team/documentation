Here you'll find official specifications published by the AROS Development
Team. These will document aspects like policies that system-friendly
applications are expected to follow, extensions to the original AmigaOS API
and other technical details specific to AROS.

Currently, no final specifications have been published, but listed below
are a number of drafts that are available for discussion.


Drafts
======

The documents listed here are draft specifications, and as such will most
likely change before they are accepted as official specifications. They
might also be deprecated if a better approach has been found in the mean time,
and don't necessarily correspond precisely with the current implementations.
