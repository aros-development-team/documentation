Device drivers development
--------------------------
+ `USB specifications`__

  The official source of USB information. Not really easy to grasp, but
  mandatory if you want to know all about USB.

+ `USB in a Nutshell (making sense of the USB standard)`__

  A quote from the site:

  "Starting out new with USB can be quite daunting. With the USB 2.0
  specification at 650 pages one could easily be put off just by the sheer
  size of the standard. [...] The good news is you don't even need to bother
  reading the entire USB standard [...] Lets take a little journey through
  the various chapters of the USB 2.0 specification and briefly introduce
  the key points."

Executable file formats
-----------------------

+ `ELF - Executable and Linking Format - Specification v1.2 - pdf version`__

  The official source of information about the ELF format. Apart from the
  specifications common to all platforms where the ELF standard is adopted,
  it also contains parts specific to the Intel architecture.

Miscellaneous operating system resources
----------------------------------------

+ `The Operating System Resource Center`__

  A comprehensive set of links to various resources related to Operating
  Systems development, like file systems, device drivers, memory management,
  and so on.

+ `Protected Mode Basics`__

  An in-depth article by Robert Collins about protected mode on the x86
  architecture. Probably contains more information about said architecture
  than you want to know... ;-)

+ `Write your own operating system`__

  Lots of useful information about the low-level bits of writing an operating
  system for the x86 architecture. Mostly about controlling the hardware, but
  also contains some useful titbits about file systems, networking, executable
  formats and other things...

+ `Write your own operating system [WIKI]`__

  Even more information about writing operating systems, although also geared
  towards the x86 architecture. Much information about the hardware, but also
  quite a lot of details on higher level things and some good references to
  useful books, tools and sources.
