Abstract
========

Summary of miscellaneous topics discussed on the aros-dev mailinglist during
January 2002.



Webspace, Download, CVS
=======================

If we don't get into sourceforge we could try savannah:
http://savannah.gnu.org/



Datatypes
=========

netpbm.datatype
---------------

I have laying around a netpbm.datatype here.

It uses NetPBM to load any picture, so we just need to port NetPBM (very
portable) to AROS to have access to every human known pictureformat on the
planet.

Oh, but you can link with libcygwin.a and avoid this restriction.
