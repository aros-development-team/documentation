Summaries
=========

Here you can find some summaries of discussions on the mailing list and a
compilation of miscellaneous ideas that have been talked about in the past.

.. Note::

    The summaries contain opinions of individual developers and should not be
    taken as official statements on what actually will be implemented in AROS.
    Because the summaries are incomplete, it is possible that opinions have
    changed since they were written and that more details have surfaced.
    Basically, don't take statements in them as anything definitive.
