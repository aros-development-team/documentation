Background
==========

There are two kinds of multitasking: Preemptive and Cooperative (sometimes
indicated as: Non-preemptive). In Preemptive multitasking, a task will get
a certain amount of CPU time and then another task gets the CPU. In
Cooperative multitasking, a task has to release the CPU, which will then
allow another task to run.

Preemptive multitasking (PMT) has these advantages:

+ It's simple to understand
+ There is no need to make sure that your task doesn't keep the CPU forever.

and these disadvantages:

+ It's complicated to exchange data with other tasks
+ You never know how long you will stay awake
+ The OS must decide which task to run next in a clever way

Cooperative Multitasking (CMT) has these advantages:

+ It's very simple to implement
+ It's easy to exchange data
+ You know exactly how long you will stay awake
+ You get most of the CPU

and these disadvantages:

+ If a task behaves badly, there is no way to stop it (for example
  if it keeps the CPU forever, all you can do is turn the computer off).
+ It's hard to make sure that every task gets the CPU now and then

Though it would seem, from the counts of advantages and disadvantages, that
CMT is better than PMT, that's not exactly true. CMT is better when you
have only a few tasks and a single user. Powerful OSes, like Unix and AmigaOS,
have PMT because it's simpler to use. The same holds for AROS.


How does preemptive multitasking work?
======================================

The idea is pretty simple: Every computer has a clock. This clock can
generate interrupts. An interrupt means that the CPU saves its current
state on the stack of the current task and starts a special routine
called the interrupt handler. Basically this handler now checks for
other tasks which might want to run, selects one of them and switches
the stack to the one of the newly chosen task. It then finishes and
tells the CPU to continue where it was before the interrupt. Since the
CPU knows nothing about all this, it will just load its state from the new
stack (i.e. the one of the new task) and so the new task will run, while
the old one will be sleeping.

Looking at it from the perspective of the life of a task: A tasks's life
consists of birth, waiting, running, and death. In computer terms, the task
is created, then waits until it gets the CPU, does its work while it has
the CPU (these two states may switch back and forth several times), and at
some point it terminates (or is terminated).
