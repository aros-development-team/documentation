Notes
~~~~~
::

     On AROS standardized C interfaces are implemented with a few shared
     libraries. A distinction is made between a standard ANSI-C/ISO-C
     part and a POSIX emulation layer.
     Here the ANSI-C/ISO-C part is documented.

     The ANSI-C/ISO-C part is implemented by the stdc.library and the
     stdcio.library shared libraries. The former implements the part that
     only depends on exec.library; the latter the parts that depends on
     other libraries like dos.library and contains mostly I/O related
     functions.
     Currently both libraries are disk based but the plan is in the future
     put stdc.library in ROM and be initialized right after exec so that
     all modules, also those in ROM can use it. stdcio.library will likely
     stay disk based.
     Purpose of these libraries is to provide a base implementation that
     can be used by compilers. Compilers are free to override functions
     with their own implementation.

     The reference used for the developing the two libraries is the ISO/IEC
     standard document ISO/IEC 9899:1999 also known as C99. Not all functions
     are implemented but for each function defined in the standard a place
     in the library is reserved. The order of the functions in the library
     lookup table is based on the order that they are defined in the standard
     document.

     Not all functions are implemented. Not implemented functions either
     are not available in the library at all or just a stub function is
     provided. The latter can be used to get programs running without having
     a proper implementation of a function. Of course target should be to
     have in the end all functions implemented.
     Consult the include files and the autodocs to see which functions are
     not (fully) implemented.

     The include files provided for the C99 code implement a proper
     separation of the include files. The includes should only define the
     prototypes as defined by the standard. This means includes like
     proto/stdc.h or proto/stdcio.h should not be included in the standard
     C99 include files. Developers improving or extending these libraries
     should keep this in mind.

     In order to use the stdc.library programs need to properly initialize
     the library using the __stdc_progam_startup() and __stdc_program_end()
     functions. It is assumed that this is taken care of by the startup
     code provided by the compiler.

--background_locale--
=====================

Notes
~~~~~
::

     Currently no real locale support is provided by stdc.library. All locale
     related functions have a minimal implementation assuming only a "C"
     locale.
     Implementing proper locale support will need careful development to have
     a consistent integration with locale.library. People with ideas can
     always post on the AROS development mailing list.

----------

--background_string--
=====================

Notes
~~~~~
::

     Contrary to the other include files; almost all string functions are
     made part of stdc.library include the POSIX and the SAS/C ones.
     These string functions are most of the small and don't depend on other
     code. Doing it this way avoids having code that only uses non C99 string
     functions having a dependency on posixc.library.

----------

--background_wchar--
====================

Notes
~~~~~
::

     wchar.h/wctype.h is not implemented by stdc.library. It is left to
     the compiler to provide their implementation of wchar support.
     No system functions should thus at the moment use wchar as
     implementation is compiler dependent.

__stdc_assert()
===============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  void __stdc_assert(
     const char * expr,
     const char * file,
     unsigned int line)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     This is a function that is used for implementation of the C99 assert()
     function.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     expr - The expression to evaluate. The type of the expression does
             not matter, only if its zero/NULL or not.
     file - Name of the source file.
     line - Line number of assert() call.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The function doesn't return.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Different versions of this function are available. This function
     is used when a program is using stdc.library but not
     stdcio.library or posixc.library.
     Because no normal DOS file I/O is available an attempt will be made
     to display the assertion in a requester and thus deviating from the
     C99 standard that says it to go to the error stream.

     This function directly jumps to the exit of a program.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     normal - Indicates if exit is normal or not. When it is abnormal no
              atexit functions will be called.
     retcode - the return code for the program.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     -


Notes
~~~~~
::

     In normal operation this function does not return.
     If this function returns it means that this function was called in a
     context where jmp_buf for exit was not initialized. Likely cause is
     a module that opened stdc.library.
     Be sure to capture this situation.

     format and be accessible through char **environ.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     At the moment only a static list is supported. getenv() and setenv()
     don't use this yet so changes done with these functions are not
     reflected in environ.
     This is still TODO.

assert()
========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  void assert(

             not matter, only if it's zero/NULL or not.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The function doesn't return.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     // Make sure that x equals 1
     assert (x==1);


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Normally the output is sent to stderr and thus this code should
     only be called from processes with the context of the process
     available.
     In low level modules it is advised to use the ASSERT() macro for
     aros/debug.h.
     As a last resort one can use the normal assert() macro but link
     with the kernelassert static link library to get a version that
     also outputs to kernel debug output.
     With this assert also an Alert will be generated in place of abort of
     the program.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Get the current position in a stream. This function is equivalent
     to ftell(). However, on some systems fpos_t may be a complex
     structure, so this routine may be the only way to portably
     get the position of a stream.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     stream - The stream to get the position from.
     pos - Pointer to the fpos_t position structure to fill.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     FILE * stream)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Read one line of characters from the stream into the buffer.
     Reading will stop, when a newline ('\n') is encountered, EOF
     or when the buffer is full. If a newline is read, then it is
     put into the buffer. The last character in the buffer is always
     '\0' (Therefore at most size-1 characters can be read in one go).


Inputs

                     at the beginning of the file.

             w: Open for writing. If the file doesn't exist, then
                     it is created. If it does already exist, then
                     it is truncated. The stream is positioned at the
                     beginning of the file.

             w+: Open for reading and writing. If the file doesn't
                     exist, then it is created. If it does already
                     exist, then it is truncated. The stream is
                     positioned at the beginning of the file.

             a: Open for writing. If the file doesn't exist, then
                     it is created. The stream is positioned at the
                     end of the file.

             a+: Open for reading and writing. If the file doesn't
                     exist, then it is created. The stream is positioned
                     at the end of the file.

             b: Open in binary more. This has no effect and is ignored.


Result

gets()
======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  char * gets(

     EOF or when the buffer is full. If a newline is read, then it is
     replaced by '\0'. The last character in the buffer is always '\0'.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     buffer - Write characters into this buffer


Result
~~~~~~
::

     buffer when successful. NULL in case of an error or when EOF without any
     characters read. In the latter case buffer array is unchanged.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     Never use this function. gets() does not know how large the buffer
     is and will continue to store characters past the end of the buffer
     if it has not encountered a newline or EOF yet. Use fgets() instead.

printf()
========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  int printf(
     const char * restrict format,
     ...)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Formats a list of arguments and prints them to standard out.

     The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary
     characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output
     stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in
     fetching zero or more subsequent arguments Each conversion
     specification is introduced by the character %. The arguments must
     correspond properly (after type promotion) with the conversion
     specifier. After the %, the following appear in sequence:

     \begin{itemize}
     \item Zero or more of the following flags:

     \begin{description}
     \item{#} specifying that the value should be converted to an
     ``alternate form''. For c, d, i, n, p, s, and u conversions, this
     option has no effect. For o conversions, the precision of the
     number is increased to force the first character of the output
     string to a zero (except if a zero value is printed with an
     explicit precision of zero). For x and X conversions, a non-zero
     result has the string `0x' (or `0X' for X conversions) prepended to
     it. For e, E, f, g, and G conversions, the result will always
     contain a decimal point, even if no digits follow it (normally, a
     decimal point appears in the results of those conversions only if a
     digit follows). For g and G conversions, trailing zeros are not
     removed from the result as they would otherwise be.

     \item{0} specifying zero padding. For all conversions except n, the
     converted value is padded on the left with zeros rather than
     blanks. If a precision is given with a numeric conversion (d, i, o,
     u, i, x, and X), the 0 flag is ignored.

     \item{-} (a negative field width flag) indicates the converted
     value is to be left adjusted on the field boundary. Except for n
     conversions, the converted value is padded on the right with
     blanks, rather than on the left with blanks or zeros. A -
     overrides a 0 if both are given.

     \item{ } (a space) specifying that a blank should be left before a
     positive number produced by a signed conversion (d, e, E, f, g, G,
     or i). + specifying that a sign always be placed before a number
     produced by a signed conversion. A + overrides a space if both are
     used.

     \item{'} specifying that in a numerical argument the output is to
     be grouped if the locale information indicates any. Note that many
     versions of gcc cannot parse this option and will issue a warning.

     \end{description}

     \item An optional decimal digit string specifying a minimum field
     width. If the converted value has fewer characters than the field
     width, it will be padded with spaces on the left (or right, if the
     left-adjustment flag has been given) to fill out the field width.

     \item An optional precision, in the form of a period (`.') followed
     by an optional digit string. If the digit string is omitted, the
     precision is taken as zero. This gives the minimum number of digits
     to appear for d, i, o, u, x, and X conversions, the number of
     digits to appear after the decimal-point for e, E, and f
     conversions, the maximum number of significant digits for g and G
     conversions, or the maximum number of characters to be printed from
     a string for s conversions.

     \item The optional character h, specifying that a following d, i,
     o, u, x, or X conversion corresponds to a short int or unsigned
     short int argument, or that a following n conversion corresponds to
     a pointer to a short int argument.

     \item The optional character l (ell) specifying that a following d,
     i, o, u, x, or X conversion applies to a pointer to a long int or
     unsigned long int argument, or that a following n conversion
     corresponds to a pointer to a long int argument. Linux provides a
     non ANSI compliant use of two l flags as a synonym to q or L. Thus
     ll can be used in combination with float conversions. This usage
     is, however, strongly discouraged.

     \item The character L specifying that a following e, E,
     f, g, or G conversion corresponds to a long double
     argument, or a following d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion corresponds to a long long argument. Note
     that long long is not specified in ANSI C and
     therefore not portable to all architectures.

     \item The optional character q. This is equivalent to L. See the
     STANDARDS and BUGS sections for comments on the use of ll, L, and
     q.

     \item A Z character specifying that the following integer (d, i, o,
     u, i, x, and X), conversion corresponds to a size_t argument.

     \item A character that specifies the type of conversion to be
     applied.

     A field width or precision, or both, may be indicated by an
     asterisk `*' instead of a digit string. In this case, an int
     argument supplies the field width or precision. A negative field
     width is treated as a left adjustment flag followed by a positive
     field width; a negative precision is treated as though it were
     missing.

     The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

     \begin{description}
     \item{diouxX} The int (or appropriate variant) argument is
     converted to signed decimal (d and i), unsigned octal (o, unsigned
     decimal (u, or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation. The letters
     abcdef are used for x conversions; the letters ABCDEF are used for
     X conversions. The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of
     digits that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer
     digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.

     \item{eE} The double argument is rounded and converted in the style
     [<->]d.dddedd where there is one digit before the decimal-point
     character and the number of digits after it is equal to the
     precision; if the precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the
     precision is zero, no decimal-point character appears. An E
     conversion uses the letter E (rather than e) to introduce the
     exponent. The exponent always contains at least two digits; if the
     value is zero, the exponent is 00.

     \item{f} The double argument is rounded and converted to decimal
     notation in the style [-]ddd.ddd, where the number of digits after
     the decimal-point character is equal to the precision
     specification. If the precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if
     the precision is explicitly zero, no decimal-point character
     appears. If a decimal point appears, at least one digit appears
     before it.

     \item{g} The double argument is converted in style f or e (or E for
     G conversions). The precision specifies the number of significant
     digits. If the precision is missing, 6 digits are given; if the
     precision is zero, it is treated as 1. Style e is used if the
     exponent from its conversion is less than -4 or greater than or
     equal to the precision. Trailing zeros are removed from the
     fractional part of the result; a decimal point appears only if it
     is followed by at least one digit.

     \item{c} The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the
     resulting character is written.

     \item{s} The ``char *'' argument is expected to be a pointer to an
     array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the
     array are written up to (but not including) a terminating NUL
     character; if a precision is specified, no more than the number
     specified are written. If a precision is given, no null character
     need be present; if the precision is not specified, or is greater
     than the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating
     NUL character.

     \item{p} The ``void *'' pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal
     (as if by %#x or %#lx).

     \item{n} The number of characters written so far is stored into the
     integer indicated by the ``int *'' (or variant) pointer argument.
     No argument is converted.

     \item{%} A `%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete
     conversion specification is `%%'.

     \end{description}
     \end{itemize}

     In no case does a non-existent or small field width cause
     truncation of a field; if the result of a conversion is wider than
     the field width, the field is expanded to contain the conversion
     result.


Inputs

     format - Format string as described above
     ... - Arguments for the format string


Result

     10:02', where weekday and month are pointers to strings:

         #include <stdio.h>

         fprintf (stdout, "%s, %s %d, %.2d:%.2d\n",
                 weekday, month, day, hour, min);

     To print to five decimal places:

         #include <math.h>
         #include <stdio.h>

         fprintf (stdout, "pi = %.5f\n", 4 * atan(1.0));

     To allocate a 128 byte string and print into it:

         #include <stdio.h>
         #include <stdlib.h>
         #include <stdarg.h>

         char *newfmt(const char *fmt, ...)
         {
             char *p;
             va_list ap;

             if ((p = malloc(128)) == NULL)
                 return (NULL);

             va_start(ap, fmt);

             (void) vsnprintf(p, 128, fmt, ap);

             va_end(ap);

             return (p);
         }


Bugs
~~~~
::

     All functions are fully ANSI C3.159-1989 conformant, but provide
     the additional flags q, Z and ' as well as an additional behavior
     of the L and l flags. The latter may be considered to be a bug, as
     it changes the behavior of flags defined in ANSI C3.159-1989.

     The effect of padding the %p format with zeros (either by the 0
     flag or by specifying a precision), and the benign effect (i.e.,
     none) of the # flag on %n and %p conversions, as well as
     nonsensical combinations such as are not standard; such
     combinations should be avoided.

     Some combinations of flags defined by ANSI C are not making sense
     in ANSI C (e.g. %Ld). While they may have a well-defined behavior
     on Linux, this need not to be so on other architectures. Therefore
     it usually is better to use flags that are not defined by ANSI C at
     all, i.e. use q instead of L in combination with diouxX conversions
     or ll. The usage of q is not the same as on BSD 4.4, as it may be
     used in float conversions equivalently to L.

     Because sprintf and vsprintf assume an infinitely long string,
     callers must be careful not to overflow the actual space; this is
     often impossible to assure.

     have been allocated by malloc(), calloc(), realloc() or realloc_nocopy().
     
     The reallocated buffer, unlike with realloc(), is not guaranteed to hold
     a copy of the old one.


Inputs
~~~~~~

     memory anymore, you can pass this pointer to free(). If you don't,
     the memory will be freed for you when the application exits.


Notes

     handler - the signal handler; can be SIG_IGN, SIG_DFL or a function
               pointer that will handle the signal


Result
~~~~~~
::

snprintf()
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  int snprintf(
     char       * str,
     size_t       n,
     const char * format,
     ...)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     C99 says:The snprintf function is equivalent to fprintf, except that the output is
     written into an array (specified by argument s) rather than to a stream. If
     n is zero, nothing is written, and s may be a null pointer. Otherwise,
     output characters beyond the n-1st are discarded rather than being written
     to the array, and a null character is written at the end of the characters
     actually written into the array. If copying takes place between objects
     that overlap, the behavior is undefined.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     str - The formatted string is written into this variable. You
           must make sure that it is large enough to contain the
           result.
     n -   At most n characters are written into the string. This
           includes the final 0.
     format - Format string as described above
     ... - Arguments for the format string


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The snprintf function returns the number of characters that would have been
     written had n been sufficiently large, not counting the terminating null
     character, or a negative value if an encoding error occurred. Thus, the
     null-terminated output has been completely written if and only if the
     returned value is nonnegative and less than n.

stpblk()
========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  char * stpblk(
     const char * str )


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Searches for the first non-blank character in a string. A blank
     character is defined as one that isspace() treats like one
     (ie. spaces, tabs and newlines).


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     str - String to search.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     A pointer to the first occurrence of a non-blank character in str.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     char *hello = " Hello";
     char *empty = "      ";
 
     printf( stpblk( hello ) );
     --> Hello
     
     printf( stpblk( empty ) );
     -->
     
     printf( "%d", strlen( stpblk( hello ) ) );
     --> 5
     
     printf( "%d", strlen( stpblk( empty ) ) );
     --> 0
     

Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function always returns a valid pointer as provided str isn't
     NULL. If there are no non-blank characters in the string, a pointer
     to the trailing '\0' is returned (ie. an empty string).

Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     dest - The string is copied into this variable. Make sure it is
            large enough.
            
     src - This is the new contents of dest.


Result
~~~~~~
::

stpsym()
========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  char * stpsym(
     char * str_ptr,
     char * dest_ptr,
     int dest_size)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Searches for a symbol in a string.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     str_ptr - points to the string to scan

     dest_ptr - points to the string where stpsym stores the symbol

     dest_size - specifies the size in bytes of *dest_ptr


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Pointer to the next character in the string after the symbol.
     If stpsym could not find a symbol, it returns str_ptr.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     #include <string.h>
     #include <stdio.h>

     int main(void)
     {
         char *text;
         char symbol[10];
         char *r;

         text = "alpha1  2";
         r = stpsym(text,symbol,10);
         printf("%s",symbol);   // prints "alpha1"
     }


Notes
~~~~~
::

     A symbol consists of an alphabetic character followed by zero
     or more alphanumeric characters.  stpsym() does not skip leading
     space characters.

     Note that if you want to retrieve a symbol of length n, you need
     to ensure that *dest_ptr can accommodate at least n+1 elements,
     and that dest_size == n+1.  This extra element is needed for the
     terminating null character.

~~~~~~~~
::

     Convert a string of digits into an integer according to the
     given base. This function is like strtol() except the fact,
     that it returns a value of type intmax_t.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     str - The string which should be converted.
     endptr - If this is non-NULL, then the address of the first
             character after the number in the string is stored
             here.
     base - The base for the number.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The value of the string. The first character after the number
     is returned in *endptr, if endptr is non-NULL. If no digits can
     be converted, *endptr contains str (if non-NULL) and 0 is
     returned.

             whitespace are ignored. The number may be prefixed
             by a '+' or '-'. If base is above 10, then the
             alphabetic characters from 'A' are used to specify
             digits above 9 (ie. 'A' or 'a' is 10, 'B' or 'b' is
             11 and so on until 'Z' or 'z' is 35).
     endptr - If this is non-NULL, then the address of the first

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  size_t strxfrm(

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     The strxfrm() function transforms a null-terminated string pointed to by
     src according to the current locale collation if any, then copies the
     transformed string into dst.  Not more than n characters are copied into
     dst, including the terminating null character added.  If n is set to 0
     (it helps to determine an actual size needed for transformation), dst is
     permitted to be a NULL pointer.

     Comparing two strings using strcmp() after strxfrm() is equal to compar-
     ing two original strings with strcoll().


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     dst - the destination string's buffer
     src - the source string
     n   - the size of the dst buffer.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Upon successful completion, strxfrm() returns the length of the trans-
     formed string not including the terminating null character.  If this
     value is n or more, the contents of dst are indeterminate.

     tloc - If this pointer is non-NULL, then the time is written into
             this variable as well.


Result

     that is not the same as the name of an existing file. The function
     is potentially capable of generating TMP_MAX different strings, but
     any or all of them may already be in use by existing files and thus
     not be suitable return values.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     Pointer to a string of at least L_tmpnam characters.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The resulting file name is returned in the input string pointer
     or a pointer to an internal buffer if NULL was passed to the function.

     const char * format,
     va_list      args)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Format a list of arguments and put them into the string str.
     The function makes sure that no more than n characters (including
     the terminal 0 byte) are written into str.
     If n is zero, nothing is written, and s may be a null pointer. Otherwise,
     output characters beyond the n-1st are discarded rather than being written
     to the array, and a null character is written at the end of the characters
     actually written into the array. If copying takes place between objects
     that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
 

Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     str - The formatted result is stored here
     n - The size of str
     format - A printf() format string.
     args - A list of arguments for the format string.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Function returns the number of characters that would have been
     written had n been sufficiently large, not counting the terminating null
     character, or a negative value if an encoding error occurred. Thus, the
     null-terminated output has been completely written if and only if the
     returned value is nonnegative and less than n.

~~~~~~
::

     wchar: wide char to convert
     s: string pointer to put the converted char into.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     If s is not NULL it returns the number of chars written into s;
     zero is returned when wchar is a NULL character; -1 when the character
