__CreateSegList()
=================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  BPTR __CreateSegList(
     APTR function, struct ExecBase *SysBase )


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Create a SegList, which contains a call to 'function'


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     function - Function to call when the SegList is executed


Result
~~~~~~
::

     BPTR to the SegList that was allocated. This SegList can
          be freed by DOS/UnloadSeg. If not enough memory,
          BNULL will be returned.

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     memory - Start here
     size - This many bytes. Must be a multiple of sizeof(ULONG)


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The checksum for the memory. If you store the checksum somewhere
     in the area and run CalcChecksum() again, the result will be 0.
     To achieve this, you must set the place, where the checksum will
     be placed later, to 0 before you call the function.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     ULONG mem[512];

     mem[0] = 0; // Store checksum here
     mem[0] = CalcChecksum (mem, sizeof (mem));

     else
         printf ("Data is unchanged.\n");

rkprintf()
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  int rkprintf(
     const STRPTR mainSystem,
     const STRPTR subSystem,
     int level,
     const char * fmt,
     ...)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Call kprintf if debugging for this main and subsystem is enabled
     at a level larger than the level above. The minimal level is 1
     (this way, debugging can be disabled in the debug config file
     by giving a level of 0).

     You should not call this function directly but use the rbug
     macro. The rbug macro does some magic to make the handling
     more simple.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     mainSystem - The main system. Use one of the DBG_MAINSYSTEM_*
             macros to avoid typos.
     subSystem - The part of the main system. Use one of the
             DBG_*_SUBSYSTEM_* macros.
     level - The debug level. Higher levels should give more details.
             The lowest level is 1.
     fmt - printf()-style format string


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The number of characters output.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     if (cache)
     {
         ...
         D(rbug(INTUITION, INPUTHANDLER, 3,
             "allocating event from cache (%p)", event
         ));
         ...
