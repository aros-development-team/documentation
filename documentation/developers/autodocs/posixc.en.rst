Notes
~~~~~
::

     On AROS standardized C interfaces are implemented with a few shared
     libraries. A distinction is made between a standard ANSI-C/ISO-C
     part and a POSIX emulation layer.
     
     Here the POSIX part is documented.

     The posixc.library is a shared library that implements (part of) the C
     interface for POSIX.1-2008 on AROS and the standard document is used
     as guideline for this implementation.
     Purpose of this library is to implement a POSIX compliant compatibility
     layer. Currently no full implementation of the POSIX layer is provided
     but enough to port a lot of POSIX compliant or LINUX code over to AROS.
     As this library has overhead in implementation 'real' AROS/Amiga programs
     should not depend on this library.

     Also some non-standard or legacy POSIX functions are provided by the
     library. If possible they are put in the static link library so the
     functions can be removed in the future without breaking backwards
     compatibility.
     When porting code it is then preferred to patch the source code to use
     the POSIX.1-2008 version of files or provide a local version of some
     of the functions.

     The include files provided for the POSIX code implement a proper
     separation of the include files. The includes should only define the
     prototypes, constants etc.  as defined by the standard. This means
     includes like proto/posixc.h should not be included in the standard
     POSIX include files. Developers improving or extending these libraries
     should keep this in mind.

     In order to use the posixc.library programs need to properly initialize
     the library using the __posixc_nixmain() function. It is assumed that
     this is taken care of by the startup code provided by the compiler.

__get_default_file()
====================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  int __get_default_file(
     int file_descriptor,
     long * file_handle)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Gets dos.library file handle associated with a given file descriptor.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     file_descriptor - the File Descriptor you wish to obtain the associated
             file handle for.
     file_handle - Pointer to store the associated file handle.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     !=0 on error, 0 on success.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function is not a part of the ISO C standard, it comes from clib2
     project and was implemented to make porting of abc-shell easier.
     Function should not be used in new code.



----------

__path_a2u()
============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  const char *__path_a2u(
     const char *apath)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Translates an AmigaDOS-style path into an unix one.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     apath - AmigaDOS-style path to translate into an unix-style equivalent.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     A pointer to a string containing the unix-style path, or NULL in
     case of error.

     The pointer is valid only until next call to this function, so if
     you need to call this function recursively, you must save the string
     pointed to by the pointer before calling this function again.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function is for private usage by system code. Do not use it
     elsewhere.



----------

__path_u2a()
============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     const char *upath)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Translates a unix-style path into an AmigaDOS one.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     upath - Unix-style path to translate into an AmigaDOS-style equivalent.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     A pointer to a string containing the AmigaDOS-style path, or NULL in
     case of error.

     The pointer is valid only until next call to this function, so if
     you need to call this function recursively, you must save the string
     pointed to by the pointer before calling this function again.

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  int __posixc_creat(
     const char * pathname,
     int          mode)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Creates a file with the specified mode and name.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Read one line of characters from the stream into the buffer.
     Reading will stop, when a newline ('\n') is encountered, EOF
     or when the buffer is full. If a newline is read, then it is
     put into the buffer. The last character in the buffer is always
     '\0' (Therefore at most size-1 characters can be read in one go).


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     buffer - Write characters into this buffer
     size - This is the size of the buffer in characters.
     stream - Read from this stream


Result
~~~~~~
::

Example
~~~~~~~
::

     // Read a file line by line
     char line[256];

     // Read until EOF

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Opens a file with the specified name in the specified mode.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     pathname - Path and filename of the file you want to open.
     mode - How to open the file:

             r: Open for reading. The stream is positioned at the
                     beginning of the file.

             r+: Open for reading and writing. The stream is positioned
                     at the beginning of the file.

             w: Open for writing. If the file doesn't exist, then
                     it is created. If it does already exist, then
                     it is truncated. The stream is positioned at the
                     beginning of the file.

             w+: Open for reading and writing. If the file doesn't
                     exist, then it is created. If it does already
                     exist, then it is truncated. The stream is
                     positioned at the beginning of the file.

             a: Open for writing. If the file doesn't exist, then
                     it is created. The stream is positioned at the
                     end of the file.

             a+: Open for reading and writing. If the file doesn't
                     exist, then it is created. The stream is positioned
                     at the end of the file.

             b: Open in binary more. This has no effect and is ignored.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     A pointer to a FILE handle or NULL in case of an error. When NULL
     is returned, then errno is set to indicate the error.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     On 32bit systems, fopen and related operations only work with
     32bit filesystems/files. Anything larger than 2 GB needs to use
     the correct 64bit structures and functions.
    
     This function must not be used in a shared library or
     in a threaded application.

     fetching zero or more subsequent arguments Each conversion
     specification is introduced by the character %. The arguments must

     specifier. After the %, the following appear in sequence:

     Zero or more of the following flags:

     # - specifying that the value should be converted to an
         ``alternate form''. For a,A,c, d, i, n, p, s, and u conversions, this
         option has no effect. For o conversions, the precision of the
         number is increased to force the first character of the output
         string to a zero (except if a zero value is printed with an
         explicit precision of zero). For x and X conversions, a non-zero
         result has the string `0x' (or `0X' for X conversions) prepended to

         contain a decimal point, even if no digits follow it (normally, a
         decimal point appears in the results of those conversions only if a
         digit follows). For g and G conversions, trailing zeros are not
         removed from the result as they would otherwise be.

     0 - specifying zero padding. For all conversions except n, the
         converted value is padded on the left with zeros rather than
         blanks. For f,F conversion, or if a precision is given with a numeric
         conversion (d, i, o,u, i, x, and X), the 0 flag is ignored.

     - - (a negative field width flag) indicates the converted
         value is to be left adjusted on the field boundary. Except for n
         conversions, the converted value is padded on the right with
         blanks, rather than on the left with blanks or zeros. A -
         overrides a 0 if both are given.

       - (a space) specifying that a blank should be left before a
         positive number produced by a signed conversion (d, e, E, f, g, G,
         or i). + specifying that a sign always be placed before a number
         produced by a signed conversion. A + overrides a space if both are
         used.

     ' - specifying that in a numerical argument the output is to
         be grouped if the locale information indicates any. Note that many
         versions of gcc cannot parse this option and will issue a warning.

     An optional decimal digit string specifying a minimum field
     width. If the converted value has fewer characters than the field
     width, it will be padded with spaces on the left (or right, if the
     left-adjustment flag has been given) to fill out the field width.

     An optional precision, in the form of a period (`.') followed
     by an optional digit string. If the digit string is omitted, the
     precision is taken as zero. This gives the minimum number of digits
     to appear for d, i, o, u, x, and X conversions, the number of
     digits to appear after the decimal-point for e, E, and f
     conversions, the maximum number of significant digits for g and G
     conversions, or the maximum number of characters to be printed from
     a string for s conversions.

     The optional character h, specifying that a following d, i,
     o, u, x, or X conversion corresponds to a short int or unsigned
     short int argument, or that a following n conversion corresponds to
     a pointer to a short int argument.

     The optional character l (ell) specifying that a following d,
     i, o, u, x, or X conversion applies to a pointer to a long int or
     unsigned long int argument, or that a following n conversion
     corresponds to a pointer to a long int argument. Linux provides a
     non ANSI compliant use of two l flags as a synonym to q or L. Thus
     ll can be used in combination with float conversions. This usage
     is, however, strongly discouraged.

     The character L specifying that a following e, E,
     f, g, or G conversion corresponds to a long double
     argument, or a following d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion corresponds to a long long argument. Note
     that long long is not specified in ANSI C and
     therefore not portable to all architectures.

     The optional character q. This is equivalent to L. See the
     STANDARDS and BUGS sections for comments on the use of ll, L, and
     q.

     A Z character specifying that the following integer (d, i, o,
     u, i, x, and X), conversion corresponds to a size_t argument.

     A character that specifies the type of conversion to be
     applied.

     A field width or precision, or both, may be indicated by an
     asterisk `*' instead of a digit string. In this case, an int
     argument supplies the field width or precision. A negative field
     width is treated as a left adjustment flag followed by a positive
     field width; a negative precision is treated as though it were
     missing.

     The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

     diouxX - The int (or appropriate variant) argument is
              converted to signed decimal (d and i), unsigned octal (o, unsigned
              decimal (u, or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation. The letters
              abcdef are used for x conversions; the letters ABCDEF are used for
              X conversions. The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of
              digits that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer
              digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.

     aA - (TODO) The double argument is rounded and converted to the C99
           floating-point number in hexadecimal notation - preserving all
           bits of precision, and presenting them in a robust way.

     eE - The double argument is rounded and converted in the style
          [<->]d.dddedd where there is one digit before the decimal-point
          character and the number of digits after it is equal to the
          precision; if the precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the
          precision is zero, no decimal-point character appears. An E
          conversion uses the letter E (rather than e) to introduce the
          exponent. The exponent always contains at least two digits; if the
          value is zero, the exponent is 00.

     fF - The double argument is rounded and converted to decimal
         notation in the style [-]ddd.ddd, where the number of digits after
         the decimal-point character is equal to the precision
         specification. If the precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if
         the precision is explicitly zero, no decimal-point character
         appears. If a decimal point appears, at least one digit appears
         before it.

     g - The double argument is converted in style f or e (or E for
         G conversions). The precision specifies the number of significant
         digits. If the precision is missing, 6 digits are given; if the
         precision is zero, it is treated as 1. Style e is used if the
         exponent from its conversion is less than -4 or greater than or
         equal to the precision. Trailing zeros are removed from the
         fractional part of the result; a decimal point appears only if it
         is followed by at least one digit.

     c - The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the
         resulting character is written.

     s - The ``char *'' argument is expected to be a pointer to an
         array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the
         array are written up to (but not including) a terminating NUL
         character; if a precision is specified, no more than the number
         specified are written. If a precision is given, no null character
         need be present; if the precision is not specified, or is greater
         than the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating
         NUL character.

     p - The ``void *'' pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal
         (as if by %#x or %#lx).

     n - The number of characters written so far is stored into the
         integer indicated by the ``int *'' (or variant) pointer argument.
         No argument is converted.

     % - A `%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete
         conversion specification is `%%'.

     In no case does a non-existent or small field width cause
     truncation of a field; if the result of a conversion is wider than
     the field width, the field is expanded to contain the conversion
     result.

                 weekday, month, day, hour, min);

     To print to five decimal places:

         #include <math.h>
         #include <stdio.h>

         fprintf (stdout, "pi = %.5f\n", 4 * atan(1.0));

     To allocate a 128 byte string and print into it:

             va_start(ap, fmt);

             (void) vsnprintf(p, 128, fmt, ap);

             va_end(ap);

             return (p);
         }


Bugs
~~~~
::

     All functions are fully ANSI C3.159-1989 conformant, but provide
     the additional flags q, Z and ' as well as an additional behaviour
     of the L and l flags. The latter may be considered to be a bug, as
     it changes the behaviour of flags defined in ANSI C3.159-1989.

     The effect of padding the %p format with zeros (either by the 0
     flag or by specifying a precision), and the benign effect (i.e.,
     none) of the # flag on %n and %p conversions, as well as
     nonsensical combinations such as are not standard; such
     combinations should be avoided.

     Some combinations of flags defined by ANSI C are not making sense
     in ANSI C (e.g. %Ld). While they may have a well-defined behaviour
     on Linux, this need not to be so on other architectures. Therefore
     it usually is better to use flags that are not defined by ANSI C at
     all, i.e. use q instead of L in combination with diouxX conversions
     or ll. The usage of q is not the same as on BSD 4.4, as it may be
     used in float conversions equivalently to L.

     Because sprintf and vsprintf assume an infinitely long string,
     callers must be careful not to overflow the actual space; this is
     often impossible to assure.

     According  to POSIX, the dirent structure contains a field
     char d_name[] of unspecified size, with at  most  NAME_MAX
     characters  preceding the terminating null character.  Use
     of other fields will harm the portability of your programs.

__posixc_tmpfile()
==================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  FILE * __posixc_tmpfile(
     void)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     The tmpfile() function returns a pointer to a stream
     associated with a file descriptor returned by the routine
     mkstemp(3).  The created file is unlinked before tmpfile()
     returns, causing the file to be automatically deleted when the
     last reference to it is closed.  The file is opened with the
     access value `w+'.  The file is created in the T: directory,
     which is the standard AROS temp directory.



Result
~~~~~~
::

     The tmpfile() function returns a pointer to an open file stream on 
     success. On error, a NULL pointer is returned and errno is set 
     appropriately.

 ERRORS 
     The tmpfile() function may fail and set the global variable
     errno for any of the errors specified for the library functions
     fdopen() or mkstemp().


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     #include <errno.h>
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <string.h>

     main()
     {
       FILE * fp;

       fp = tmpfile();
       if ( fp == NULL)
       {
         perror(strerror(errno));
         return;
       }

       fprintf(fp, "do a bit of writing to the temp file");
     }


Bugs
~~~~
::

     BUG1: The temporary file is neither closed nor deleted. Ideally,
     unlink() could be used to mark the temp file for removal (see
     BUG1 in the source code) - but I suspect a bug in unlink() itself,
     whereby it tries to remove the file straight away, rather than
     waiting for all references to it to be closed. The bug is not too
     serious, because all temp files are written to the T: directory,
     which get zapped when AROS is closed down. However, problems may
     exist when you start creating over 26 temp files with the same PID.

chdir()
=======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  int chdir(
     const char *path )


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Change the current working directory to the one specified by path.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     path - Path of the directory to change to.
     

Result
~~~~~~
::

     If the current directory was changed successfully, zero is returned.
     Otherwise, -1 is returned and errno set appropriately.
     

Notes
~~~~~
::

     At program exit, the current working directory will be changed back
     to the one that was current when the program first started. If you
     do not desire this behavior, use dos.library/CurrentDir() instead.
     The path given to chdir can be translated so that getcwd gives back
     a string that is not the same but points to the same directory. For
     example, assigns are replaced by the path where the assign points to
     and device names (like DH0:) are replaced with the volume name
     (e.g. Workbench:).

dup()
=====

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  int dup(

     )


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Duplicates a file descriptor.

     The object referenced by the descriptor does not distinguish between oldd
     and newd in any way.  Thus if newd and oldd are duplicate references to
     an open file, read(),  write() and lseek() calls all move a single
     pointer into the file, and append mode, non-blocking I/O and asynchronous
     I/O options are shared between the references.  If a separate pointer
     into the file is desired, a different object reference to the file must be
     obtained by issuing an additional open(2) call.  The close-on-exec flag
     on the new file descriptor is unset.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     oldfd - The file descriptor to be duplicated


Result
~~~~~~
::

     -1 for error or the new descriptor.

     The new descriptor returned by the call is the lowest numbered
     descriptor currently not in use by the process.

dup2()
======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  int dup2(
     int oldfd,
     int newfd
     )


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Duplicates a file descriptor.

     The object referenced by the descriptor does not distinguish between
     oldfd and newfd in any way. Thus if newfd and oldfd are duplicate
     references to an open file, read(), write() and lseek() calls all
     move a single pointer into the file, and append mode, non-blocking
     I/O and asynchronous I/O options are shared between the references.
     If a separate pointer into the file is desired, a different object
     reference to the file must be obtained by issuing an additional
     open(2) call.

     The close-on-exec flag on the new file descriptor is unset.

     If oldfd is valid and has the same integer value as newfd, nothing is
     done, and newfd is returned unchanged.

     If newfd is already valid when this function is called, its old
     descriptor is deallocated before this function returns.

     This function fails gracefully if oldfd is invalid.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     oldfd - The file descriptor to be duplicated
     newfd - The value of the new descriptor we want the old one to be
         duplicated in


Result
~~~~~~

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Perform operation specified in cmd on the file descriptor fd.
     Some operations require additional arguments, in this case they
     follow the cmd argument. The following operations are available:

     F_DUPFD (int)  - Duplicate file descriptor fd as the lowest numbered
                      file descriptor greater or equal to the operation
                      argument.

     F_GETFD (void) - Read the file descriptor flags

     F_SETFD (int)  - Set the file descriptor flags to value given in
                      the operation argument

     F_GETFL (void) - Read the file status flags

     F_SETFL (int)  - Set the file status flags to value given in the
                      operation argument.

     File descriptor flags are zero or more ORed constants:

     FD_CLOEXEC - File descriptor will be closed during execve()

     File descriptor flags are not copied during duplication of file
     descriptors.

     File status flags are the flags given as mode parameter to open()
     function call. You can change only a few file status flags in opened
     file descriptor: O_NONBLOCK, O_APPEND and O_ASYNC. Any other file
     status flags passed in F_SETFL argument will be ignored.

     All duplicated file descriptors share the same set of file status
     flags.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     fd - File descriptor to perform operation on.
     cmd - Operation specifier.
     ... - Operation arguments.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The return value of the function depends on the performed operation:

     F_DUPFD  - New duplicated file descriptor

     F_GETFD  - File descriptor flags

     F_SETFD  - 0

     F_GETFL  - File status flags

     F_SETFL  - 0 on success, -1 on error. In case of error a global errno
            variable is set.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     function associates a stream with an existing file descriptor.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     filedes - The descriptor the stream has to be associated with
     mode    - The mode of the stream  (same as with fopen()) must be com­patible
               with the mode of the file  descriptor.   The  file
               position  indicator  of  the  new  stream  is  set to that
               belonging to filedes, and the error and end-of-file indicators
               are cleared.  Modes "w" or "w+" do not cause truncation of the
               file.  The file descriptor is not duplicated,  and
               will  be  closed  when  the  stream  created  by fdopen is
               closed.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     NULL on error or the new stream associated with the descriptor.

flock()
=======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  int flock(

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Apply or remove an advisory lock on open file descriptor fd. Operation
     argument can be one of the following constants:
     
     LOCK_SH - Place a shared lock on the file specified by fd. More that
               one process can hold a shared lock on a given file at a
               time.
     
     LOCK_EX - Place an exclusive lock on the file specified by fd. Only
               one process can hold an exclusive lock on a given file at
               a time.
     
     LOCK_UN - Remove an existing lock from the file specified by fd.

     LOCK_EX operation blocks if there is a lock already placed on the
     file. LOCK_SH blocks if there is an exclusive lock already placed
     on the file. If you want to do a non-blocking request, OR the
     operation specifier with LOCK_NB constant. In this case flock() will
     return -1 instead of blocking and set errno to EWOULDBLOCK.
     
     Advisory locks created with flock() are shared among duplicated file
     descriptors.
     

Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     fd - File descriptor of the file you want to place or remove lock from.
     operation - Lock operation to be performed.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     0 on success, -1 on error. In case of error a global errno variable
     is set.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Locks placed with flock() are only advisory, they place no
     restrictions to any file or file descriptor operations.

                     positioned at the beginning of the file.

             a: Open for writing. If the file doesn't exist, then
                     it is created. The stream is positioned at the

             a+: Open for reading and writing. If the file doesn't
                     exist, then it is created. The stream is positioned
                     at the end of the file.

             b: Open in binary more. This has no effect and is ignored.

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  int fseeko64(
     FILE * stream,
     off64_t  offset,
     int    whence)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Change the current position in a stream.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     stream - Modify this stream
     offset, whence - How to modify the current position. whence
             can be SEEK_SET, then offset is the absolute position
             in the file (0 is the first byte), SEEK_CUR then the
             position will change by offset (ie. -5 means to move
             5 bytes to the beginning of the file) or SEEK_END.
             SEEK_END means that the offset is relative to the
             end of the file (-1 is the last byte and 0 is
             the EOF).


Result
~~~~~~
::

     0 on success and -1 on error. If an error occurred, the global

getopt_long()
=============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  int getopt_long(
     int nargc,
     char * const *nargv,
     const char *options,
     const struct option *long_options,
     int *idx)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     The getopt_long() function is similar to getopt() but it accepts options
     in two forms: words and characters.  The getopt_long() function provides
     a superset of the functionality of getopt(3).  The getopt_long() function
     can be used in two ways.  In the first way, every long option understood
     by the program has a corresponding short option, and the option structure
     is only used to translate from long options to short options.  When used
     in this fashion, getopt_long() behaves identically to getopt(3).  This is
     a good way to add long option processing to an existing program with the
     minimum of rewriting.

     In the second mechanism, a long option sets a flag in the option struc-
     ture passed, or will store a pointer to the command line argument in the
     option structure passed to it for options that take arguments.  Addition-
     ally, the long option's argument may be specified as a single argument
     with an equal sign, e.g.,

        myprogram --myoption=somevalue

     When a long option is processed, the call to getopt_long() will return 0.
     For this reason, long option processing without shortcuts is not back-
     wards compatible with getopt(3).

     It is possible to combine these methods, providing for long options pro-
     cessing with short option equivalents for some options.  Less frequently
     used options would be processed as long options only.

     The getopt_long() call requires a structure to be initialized describing
     the long options.       The structure is:

        struct option {
                char *name;
                int has_arg;
                int *flag;
                int val;
        };

     The name field should contain the option name without the leading double
     dash.

     The has_arg field should be one of:

        no_argument        no argument to the option is expect
        required_argument  an argument to the option is required
        optional_argument  an argument to the option may be presented.

     If flag is not NULL, then the integer pointed to by it will be set to the
     value in the val field.  If the flag field is NULL, then the val field
     will be returned.       Setting flag to NULL and setting val to the corre-
     sponding short option will make this function act just like getopt(3).

     If the longindex field is not NULL, then the integer pointed to by it
     will be set to the index of the long option relative to longopts.

     The last element of the longopts array has to be filled with zeroes.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     See above


Result
~~~~~~
::

     If the flag field in struct option is NULL, getopt_long() and
     getopt_long_only() return the value specified in the val field, which is
     usually just the corresponding short option.  If flag is not NULL, these
     functions return 0 and store val in the location pointed to by flag.
     These functions return `:' if there was a missing option argument, `?' if
     the user specified an unknown or ambiguous option, and -1 when the argu-
     ment list has been exhausted.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Due to the usage of global variables this function is now put in
     the static link library. This means each compilation unit using
     getopt_long has its own getopt_long state tracking.

     const char *options,
     const struct option *long_options,
     int *idx)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     The getopt_long_only() function behaves identically to getopt_long() with
     the exception that long options may start with `-' in addition to `--'.
     If an option starting with `-' does not match a long option but does
     match a single-character option, the single-character option is returned.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Reposition read/write file offset


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     filedef - the filedescriptor being modified
     offset, whence -
               How to modify the current position. whence
               can be SEEK_SET, then offset is the absolute position
               in the file (0 is the first byte), SEEK_CUR then the
               position will change by offset (ie. -5 means to move
               5 bytes to the beginning of the file) or SEEK_END.
               SEEK_END means that the offset is relative to the
               end of the file (-1 is the last byte and 0 is
               the EOF).


Result
~~~~~~
::

     variable errno is set.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     File is extended with zeros if desired position is beyond the end of
     file.

     Since it's not possible to use Seek() for directories, this
     implementation fails with EISDIR for directory file descriptors.

Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     template - template to change into unique filename


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Returns template.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Template must end in "XXXXXX" (i.e at least 6 X's).
     
     Prior to this paragraph being created, mktemp() sometimes produced filenames
     with '/' in them. AROS doesn't like that at all. Fortunately, the bug in this
     function which produced it has been fixed. -- blippy
             
     For clarity, define the HEAD of the template to be the part before the tail,
     and the TAIL to be the succession of X's. So in, T:temp.XXXXXX , the head is
     T:temp. and the tail is XXXXXX .
     

Bugs
~~~~
::

     Cannot create more than 26 filenames for the same process id. This is because
     the "bumping" is only done to the first tail character - it should be
     generalized to bump more characters if necessary.

open()
======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  int open(
     const char * pathname,
     int              flags,
     ...)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Opens a file with the specified flags and name.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     pathname - Path and filename of the file you want to open.
     flags - Most be exactly one of: O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY or O_RDWR
             to open a file for reading, writing or for reading and
             writing.

             The mode can be modified by or'ing the following bits in:

             O_CREAT: Create the file if it doesn't exist (only for
                     O_WRONLY or O_RDWR). If this flag is set, then
                     open() will look for a third parameter mode. mode
                     must contain the access modes for the file
                     (mostly 0644).
             O_EXCL: Only with O_CREAT. If the file does already exist,
                     then open() fails. See BUGS.
             O_NOCTTY:
             O_TRUNC: If the file exists, then it gets overwritten. This
                     is the default and the opposite to O_APPEND.
             O_APPEND: If the file exists, then the starting position for
                     writes is the end of the file.
             O_NONBLOCK or O_NDELAY: Opens the file in non-blocking mode.
                     If there is no data in the file, then read() on a
                     terminal will return immediately instead of waiting
                     until data arrives. Has no effect on write().
             O_SYNC: The process will be stopped for each write() and the
                     data will be flushed before the write() returns.
                     This ensures that the data is physically written
                     when write() returns. If this flag is not specified,
                     the data is written into a buffer and flushed only
                     once in a while.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     -1 for error or a file descriptor for use with read(), write(), etc.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     If the filesystem doesn't allow to specify different access modes
     for users, groups and others, then the user modes are used.

     This function must not be used in a shared library or
     in a threaded application.



Bugs
~~~~
::

     The flag O_EXCL is not very reliable if the file resides on a NFS
     filesystem.

     Most flags are not supported right now.

Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     command - Pointer to a null terminated string containing the command
               to be executed by the shell.

     mode - Since a pipe is unidirectional, mode can be only one of

             r: Open for reading. After popen() returns, the stream can
                be used to read from it, as if it were a normal file stream,
                in order to get the command's output.

             w: Open for writing. After popen() returns, the stream can
                be used to write to it, as if it were a normal file stream,
                in order to provide the command with some input.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     A pointer to a FILE handle or NULL in case of an error. When NULL
     is returned, then errno is set to indicate the error.

     was not a multiple of sizeof(void *).
     Returns ENOMEM if there was insufficient memory to fulfill the request.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Memory allocated by posix_memalign() should be freed with free(). If

     reached.

     The data returned by readdir() is  overwritten  by subsequent
     calls to readdir() for the same directory stream.

     According  to POSIX, the dirent structure contains a field
     char d_name[] of unspecified size, with at  most  NAME_MAX
     characters  preceding the terminating null character.  Use
     of other fields will harm the portability of your programs.

Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     env - The context/environment to restore
     val - This value is returned by setjmp() when you return to the
             saved context. You cannot return 0. If val is 0, then

sigsuspend()
============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  int sigsuspend(
     const sigset_t *mask)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     replace the callers signal mask, and suspend it
     until it signaled to terminate, or to invoke a
     signal handler.

     If the signal terminates the process, sigsuspend()
     doesn't return.

     If the signal is caught, sigsuspend() returns following the
     signal handler, and the signal mask is restored to
     the state prior to calling sigsuspend().

     SIGKILL or SIGSTOP cannot be blocked; specifying
     them in the mask has no effect on the process's signal mask.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     always returns -1, normally with the error EINTR.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Not implemented.

     Normally used in conjunction with sigprocmask(), to prevent
     signal delivery during critical code sections. Callers must
     block the signals with sigprocmask(). On completion, the caller
     waits for signals by calling sigsuspend() with the return value
     of sigprocmask()

::

     The sleep() function makes the current process sleep for the

     is not ignored.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     seconds - The number of seconds to sleep


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Zero if the requested time has elapsed, or the number of seconds
     left to sleep when the process was signaled.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     // Sleep for 10 seconds
     sleep( 10 );
     

Bugs
~~~~
::

     The current implementation simply uses the dos.library function
     Delay() to sleep, and cannot be interrupted by incoming signals.
     This shouldn't be of any importance, since AROS doesn't have
     POSIX style signaling yet (but when it is implemented, this
     function needs to be changed).

vfork()
=======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  pid_t vfork(
     void)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Function to create a subprocess of the current process.

     This is there to ease porting of software using the fork()/vfork()
     POSIX functions. Due to a different memory and process model, fork()
     is not implemented at the moment in the C library. vfork() is provided
     with some extended functionality. In the POSIX standard the only
     guaranteed functionality for vfork() is to have an exec*() function or
     exit() called right after the vfork() in the child.

     Extra functionality for vfork():
     - The child has its own memory heap; memory allocation/deallocation
       is allowed and the heap will be removed when calling _exit() or will
       be used for the code started by the exec*() functions.
     - The child will have a copy of the file descriptors as specified by
       the POSIX standard for the fork() function. File I/O is possible in
       the child, as is file manipulation with dup() etc.

     Difference with fork():
     - The virtual memory heap is not duplicated as in POSIX but the memory
       is shared between parent and child. AROS lives in one big single
       memory region so changes to memory in the child are also seen by the
       parent.

     Behavior for other resources not described in this doc may not be
     relied on for future compatibility.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     -


Result
~~~~~~
::

     -1: error, no child is started; errno will be set.
     0: Running in child
     >0: Running in parent, pid of child is return value.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Current implementation of vfork() will only really start running things
     in parallel on an exec*() call. After vfork(), child code will run until
     _exit() or exec*(). With _exit(), the child will exit and the parent
     will continue; with exec*(), the child will be detached and the parent
     will continue.

wait()
======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

  pid_t wait(
     int *status)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Waits for child process to change state. State change is one of the
     following events: child has exited, child was terminated by a signal,
     child was stopped by a signal, child was resumed by a signal.
     
     The function stores status of the process that changed state in the
     pointer given as status argument.

     The following macros can be used to extract information from the
     status value:

     WIFEXITED(status)    - true if the process has exited
     WEXITSTATUS(status)  - exit status of the exited process
     WIFSIGNALED(status)  - true if the child process was terminated by a
                            signal
     WTERMSIG(status)     - number of the signal that caused process
                            termination
     WIFSTOPPED(status)   - true if the child process was stopped by a
                            signal
     WSTOPSIG(status)     - number of the signal that caused child process
                            stop
     WIFCONTINUED(status) - true if the child process was resumed by the
                            SIGCONT signal.
     
     Parent process will be suspended until a child changes state. If a
     child process has already changed state, function returns immediately.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     status - Pointer to int where child return status will be stored or
     NULL if you don't want to store status.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Process id of the child process on success or -1 on error. If an error
     occurred, the global variable errno is set.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function will work only for child processes notifying parent
     process of their death, for example processes created by vfork() call.
     If you want to use it for other processes, remember to set the
     NP_NotifyOnDeath tag value to TRUE during child process creation.

::

     Waits for child process with given process id to change state. State
     change is one of the following events: child has exited, child was
     terminated by a signal, child was stopped by a signal, child was
     resumed by a signal.
     
     The function stores status of the process that changed state in the
     pointer given as status argument.

     The following macros can be used to extract information from the
     status value:

     WIFEXITED(status)    - true if the process has exited
     WEXITSTATUS(status)  - exit status of the exited process
     WIFSIGNALED(status)  - true if the child process was terminated by a
                            signal
     WTERMSIG(status)     - number of the signal that caused process
                            termination
     WIFSTOPPED(status)   - true if the child process was stopped by a
                            signal
     WSTOPSIG(status)     - number of the signal that caused child process
                            stop
     WIFCONTINUED(status) - true if the child process was resumed by the
                            SIGCONT signal.

     Unless WNOHANG option is set, parent process will be suspended until a
     child changes state. If a child process has already changed state,
     function returns immediately.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     pid - Process id of the process you want to wait for or -1 to wait for
             any child process
     status - Pointer to int where child status will be stored or NULL if
             you don't want to store status.
     options - ORed zero or more of the following constants:
     
         WNOHANG - return immediately if no child process changed state


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Process id of the child process on success or -1 on error. If an error
     occurred, the global variable errno is set.


Notes

::

     This function will work only for child processes notifying parent
     process of their death, for example processes created by vfork() call.
