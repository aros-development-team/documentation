AbortIO()
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG AbortIO(
          struct IORequest * iORequest );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Calls the AbortIO vector of the appropriate device to stop an
     asynchronously started io request before completion. This may
     or may not be done. You still have to do a WaitIO() on the
     iorequest structure.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     iORequest - Pointer to iorequest structure.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Errorcode if the abort request failed, 0 if the abort request went
     well. io_Error will then be set to IOERR_ABORTED.

AddDevice()
===========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void AddDevice(
          struct Device * device );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Adds a given device to the system's device list after checksumming
     the device vectors. This function is not for general use but
     (of course) for building devices that don't use exec's MakeLibrary()
     mechanism.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     device - Pointer to a ready for use device structure.

----------

AddHead()
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void AddHead(
          struct List * list,
          struct Node * node );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Insert Node node as the first node of the list.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     list - The list to insert the node into
     node - This node is to be inserted


Result
~~~~~~
::

     None.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     struct List * list;
     struct Node * pred;

     // Insert Node at top
     AddHead (list, node);

AddIntServer()
==============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void AddIntServer(
          ULONG intNumber,
          struct Interrupt * interrupt );

Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function also enables the corresponding chipset interrupt if
     run on a native Amiga.



----------

AddLibrary()
============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void AddLibrary(
          struct Library * library );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Adds a given library to the system's library list after checksumming
     the library vectors. This function is not for general use but
     (of course) for building shared libraries that don't use exec's
     MakeLibrary() mechanism.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     library - Pointer to a ready for use library structure.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Some old Amiga software expects that AddLibrary returns the
     library which was just added. When in binary compatibility mode
     AROS does this too.

----------

AddMemHandler()
===============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void AddMemHandler(
          struct Interrupt * memHandler );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Add some function to be called if the system is low on memory.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     memHandler - An Interrupt structure to add to the low memory
          handler list.



----------

AddMemList()
============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void AddMemList(
          IPTR size,
          ULONG attributes,
          LONG pri,
          APTR base,
          STRPTR name );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Add a new block of memory to the system memory lists.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     size       - Size of the block
     attributes - The attributes the memory will have
     pri        - Priority in the list of MemHeaders
     base       - Base address
     name       - A name associated with the memory


Notes
~~~~~
::

     No argument checking done.



----------

AddPort()
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void AddPort(
          struct MsgPort * port );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Add a port to the public port list. The ln_Name and ln_Pri fields
     must be initialized prior to calling this function, while
     the port itself is reinitialized before adding. Therefore it's
     not allowed to add an active port.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     port - Pointer to messageport structure.



----------

AddResetCallback()
==================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL AddResetCallback(
          struct Interrupt * interrupt );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Install a system reset notification callback. The callback
     will be called whenever system reboot is performed.

     The given Interrupt structure is inserted into the callback list
     according to its priority. The callback code is called with the same
     arguments as an interrupt server.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     interrupt - A pointer to an Interrupt structure


Result
~~~~~~
::

     TRUE for success, FALSE for failure


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function is compatible with AmigaOS v4.



----------

AddResource()
=============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void AddResource(
          APTR resource );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Adds a given resource to the system's resource list.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     resource - Pointer to a ready for use resource.

~~~~~~~~

`RemResource()`_ `OpenResource()`_ 

----------

AddSemaphore()
==============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void AddSemaphore(
          struct SignalSemaphore * sigSem );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Adds a semaphore to the system public semaphore list. Since the
     semaphore gets initialized by this function it must be free at
     this time. Also the ln_Name field must be set.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     sigSem - Pointer to semaphore structure


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Semaphores are shared between the tasks that use them and must
     therefore lie in public (or at least shared) memory.



----------

AddTail()
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void AddTail(
          struct List * list,
          struct Node * node );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Insert Node node at the end of a list.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     list - The list to insert the node into
     node - This node is to be inserted


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     struct List * list;
     struct Node * pred;

     // Insert Node at end of the list
     AddTail (list, node);



----------

AddTask()
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 APTR AddTask(
          struct Task * task,
          APTR initialPC,
          APTR finalPC );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Add a new task to the system. If the new task has the highest
     priority of all and task switches are allowed it will be started
     immediately.

     You must initialise certain fields, and allocate a stack before
     calling this function. The fields that must be initialised are:
     tc_SPLower, tc_SPUpper, tc_SPReg, and the tc_Node structure.

     If any other fields are initialised to zero, then they will be
     filled in with the system defaults.

     The value of tc_SPReg will be used as the location for the stack
     pointer. You can place any arguments you wish to pass to the Task
     onto the stack before calling AddTask(). However note that you may
     need to consider the stack direction on your processor.

     Memory can be added to the tc_MemEntry list and will be freed when
     the task dies. The new task's registers are set to 0.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     task      - Pointer to task structure.
     initialPC - Entry point for the new task.
     finalPC   - Routine that is called if the initialPC() function
                 returns. A NULL pointer installs the default finalizer.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The address of the new task or NULL if the operation failed.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Use of AddTask() is deprecated on AROS; NewAddTask() should be used
     instead. AddTask() is only retained for backwards compatiblity.

     No proper initialization for alternative stack is done so alternative
     stack can't be in tasks started with AddTask(). This means that on
     some archs no shared library functions can be called.

Alert()
=======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void Alert(
          ULONG alertNum );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Alerts the user of a serious system problem.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     alertNum - This is a number which contains information about
             the reason for the call.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     This routine may return, if the alert is not a dead-end one.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     // Dead-End alert: 680x0 Access To Odd Address
     Alert (0x80000003);


Notes
~~~~~
::

     You should not call this routine because it halts the machine,
     displays the message and then may reboot it.



----------

AllocAbs()
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 APTR AllocAbs(
          IPTR byteSize,
          APTR location );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Allocate some memory from the system memory pool at a given address.
     The memory must be freed with FreeMem().


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     byteSize - Number of bytes you want to get
     location - Where you want to get the memory


Result
~~~~~~
::

     A pointer to some memory including the requested bytes or NULL if
     the memory couldn't be allocated.

----------

Allocate()
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 APTR Allocate(
          struct MemHeader * freeList,
          IPTR byteSize );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Allocate memory out of a private region handled by the MemHeader
     structure.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     freeList - Pointer to the MemHeader structure which holds the memory
     byteSize - Number of bytes you want to get


Result
~~~~~~
::

     A pointer to the number of bytes you wanted or NULL if the memory
     couldn't be allocated


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     #define POOLSIZE 4096
     \* Get a MemHeader structure and some private memory *\
     mh=(struct MemHeader *)
         AllocMem(sizeof(struct MemHeader)+POOLSIZE,MEMF_ANY);
     if(mh!=NULL)
     {
         \* Build a private pool *\
         mh->mh_First=(struct MemChunk *)(mh+1);
         mh->mh_First->mc_Next=NULL;
         mh->mh_First->mc_Bytes=POOLSIZE;
         mh->mh_Free=POOLSIZE;
         {
         \* Use the pool *\
         UBYTE *mem1,*mem2;
         mem1=Allocate(mh,1000);
         mem2=Allocate(mh,2000);

AllocEntry()
============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct MemList * AllocEntry(
          struct MemList * entry );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Allocate a number of memory blocks through a MemList structure.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     entry - The MemList with one MemEntry for each block you want to get


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The allocation was successful if the most significant bit of the
     result is 0. The result then contains a pointer to a copy of
     the MemList structure with the me_Addr fields filled.
     If the most significant bit is set the result contains the type of
     memory that couldn't be allocated.

Notes
~~~~~
::

     AVL trees are balanced binary search trees.  This implementation is
     based on embedding the struct AVLNode within your own data object
     and providing custom comparison functions wherever they are needed.

     Two comparison functions are needed for different cases.  It is entirely
     up to the application as to how it interprets the nodes and compares
     the keys.

     AVLNODECOMP is used to compare the keys of two nodes.

     typedef LONG *AVLNODECOMP(const struct AVLNode *avlnode1,
                               const struct AVLNode *avlnode2);
             D0                A0, A1

     AVLKEYCOMP is used to compare a key to a node.

     typedef LONG *AVLKEYCOMP(const struct AVLNode *avlnode,
                              AVLKey key);
             D0               A0, A1

     These functions must return the same sense for the same key values.
     That is,
         <0  if key of avlnode1 <  key of avlnode2
             if key of avlnode  <  key
          0  if key of avlnode1 == key of avlnode2
             if key of avlnode  == key
         >0  if key of avlnode1 >  key of avlnode2
             if key of avlnode  <  key

     Since this function returns the existing node if the keys match,
     this function can be used to efficiently add items to the tree or
     update existing items without requiring additional lookups.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

Inputs
~~~~~~
::

Result
~~~~~~
::

     NULL if the tree is empty (i.e. Root is NULL), or the node

     clear the cache. For example:

         DMA
         Code relocation to run at a different address
         Building jump tables
         Loading code from disk


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The caches will be flushed.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     It is possible that on some systems the entire cache will be
     even if this was not the specific request.

CacheControl()
==============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 ULONG CacheControl(
          ULONG cacheBits,
          ULONG cacheMask );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     This function will provide global control of all the processor
     instruction and data caches. It is not possible to have per
     task control.

     The actions undertaken by this function are very CPU dependant,
     however the actions performed will match the specified options
     as close as is possible.

     The commands currently defined in the include file exec/execbase.h
     are closely related to the cache control register of the Motorola
     MC68030 CPU.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     cacheBits   -   The new state of the bits
     cacheMask   -   A mask of the bits you wish to change.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     oldBits     -   The complete value of the cache control bits
                     prior to the call of this function.

     Your requested actions will have been performed. As a side effect
     this function will also cause the caches to be cleared.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     On CPU's without a separate instruction and data cache, these will
     be considered as equal.

     This function isn't implemented on all platforms.

CachePostDMA()
==============

Synopsis

 void CachePostDM(
          APTR address,
          ULONG * length,
          TAG tag, ... );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Do everything necessary to make CPU caches aware that a DMA has
     happened.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     address - Virtual address of memory affected by the DMA
     *length - Number of bytes affected
     flags   - DMA_NoModify    - Indicate that the memory did not change.
               DMA_ReadFromRAM - Indicate that the DMA goes from RAM
                                 to the device. Set this bit in
                                 both calls.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     DMA must follow a call to CachePreDMA() and must be followed
     by a call to CachePostDMA().

CachePreDMA()
=============

Synopsis

 APTR CachePreDM(
          APTR address,
          ULONG * length,
          TAG tag, ... );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Do everything necessary to make CPU caches aware that a DMA
     will happen. Virtual memory systems will make it possible
     that your memory is not at one block and not at the address
     you thought. This function gives you all the information
     you need to split the DMA request up and to convert virtual
     to physical addresses.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     address - Virtual address of memory affected by the DMA
     *length - Number of bytes affected
     flags   - DMA_Continue    - This is a call to continue a
                                 request that was broken up.
               DMA_ReadFromRAM - Indicate that the DMA goes from
                                 RAM to the device. Set this bit
                                 in both calls.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The physical address in memory.
     *length contains the number of contiguous bytes in physical
     memory.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     DMA must follow a call to CachePreDMA() and must be followed
     by a call to CachePostDMA().

Cause()
=======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void Cause(
          struct Interrupt * softint );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Schedule a software interrupt to occur. If the processor is
     currently running a user task, then the software interrupt will
     pre-empt the current task and run itself. From a real interrupt, it
     will queue the software interrupt for a later time.

     Software interrupts are useful from hardware interrupts if you
     wish to defer your processing down to a lower level. They can
     also be used in some special cases of device I/O. The timer.device
     and audio.device allow software interrupt driven timing and
     audio output respectively.

     Software interrupts are restricted to 5 different priority levels,
     +32, +16, 0, -16, -32.

     Software interrupts can only be scheduled once.

     The software interrupt is called with the following prototype:

 AROS_INTC1(YourIntCode, APTR, interruptData)

     The interruptData is the value of the is_Data field.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     softint     -   The interrupt you wish to schedule. When setting up
                     you should set the type of the interrupt to either
                     NT_INTERRUPT or NT_UNKNOWN.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The software interrupt will be delivered, or queued for later
     delivery.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     No bounds checking on the software interrupt priority is done.
     Passing a bad priority to the system can have a strange effect.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     Older versions of the Amiga operating system require that the
     software interrupts preserve the A6 register.

     Software interrupts which are added from a software interrupt of
     lower priority may not be called immediately.



----------

CheckIO()
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct IORequest * CheckIO(
          struct IORequest * iORequest );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Check if an I/O request is completed.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     iORequest - Pointer to iorequest structure.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Pointer to the iorequest structure or NULL if the device is still
     at work.

ChildFree()
===========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void ChildFree(
          ULONG tid );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Clean up after a child process.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     tid     --  Id of the child to clean up. This is not the same as
                 the Task pointer.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The child will be freed.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function will work correctly only for child tasks that are
     processes created with NP_NotifyOnDeath set to TRUE.

     Calling ChildFree() on a running child is likely to crash your
     system badly.



----------

ChildOrphan()
=============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 ULONG ChildOrphan(
          ULONG tid );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     ChildOrphan() will detach the specified task from its parent
     task's child task tree. This is useful if the parent task will be
     exiting, and no longer needs to be told about child task events.

     Note that the default Task finaliser will orphan any remaining
     children when the task exits. This function can be used if you just
     do not wish to be told about a particular task.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     tid     --  The ID of the task to orphan, or 0 for all tasks. Note
                 that it is NOT the pointer to the task.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Will return 0 on success or CHILD_* on an error.

     The child/children will no longer participate in child task
     actions.



----------

ChildStatus()
=============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 ULONG ChildStatus(
          ULONG tid );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Return the status of a child task. This allows the Task to
     determine whether a particular child task is still running or not.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     tid     --  The ID of the task to examine. Note that it is _NOT_
                 a task pointer.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     One of the CHILD_* values.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function will work correctly only for child tasks that are
     processes created with NP_NotifyOnDeath set to TRUE. Otherwise
     it may report CHILD_NOTFOUND even if child already exited.



----------

ChildWait()
===========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 IPTR ChildWait(
          ULONG tid );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Wait for either a specific child task, or any child task to finish.
     If you specify tid = 0, then the call will return when any child
     task exits, otherwise it will not return until the requested task
     finishes.

     Note that the tid is NOT the task control block (ie struct Task *),
     rather it is the value of the ETask et_UniqueID field. Passing in a
     Task pointer will cause your Task to deadlock.

     You must call ChildFree() on the returned task before calling
     ChildWait() again. Ie.

         struct ETask *et;

         et = ChildWait(0);
         ChildFree(et->et_UniqueID);


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     tid -   The UniqueID of a task.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Returns either the ETask structure of the child, or one of the
     CHILD_* values on error.

     This allows you to work out which of the children has exited.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function will work correctly only for child tasks that are
     processes created with NP_NotifyOnDeath set to TRUE.

     Calling ChildWait() on a task that isn't your child will result in
     a deadlock.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     Be careful with the return result of this function.



----------

CloseDevice()
=============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void CloseDevice(
          struct IORequest * iORequest );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Closes a previously opened device. Any outstanding I/O requests must
     be finished. It is safe to call CloseDevice with a cleared iorequest
     structure or one that failed to open.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     iORequest - Pointer to iorequest structure.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     This function will reboot the computer.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     None.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     This function does not return.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     It can be quite harmful to call this function. It may be possible that
     you will lose data from other tasks not having saved, or disk buffers
     not being flushed. Plus you could annoy the (other) users.

CreateIORequest()
=================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 APTR CreateIORequest(
          struct MsgPort * ioReplyPort,
          ULONG size );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Create an I/O request structure bound to a given messageport.
     I/O requests are normally used to communicate with exec devices
     but can be used as normal messages just as well.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     ioReplyPort - Pointer to that one of your messageports where
                   the messages are replied to. A NULL port is legal
                   but then the function fails always.
     size        - Size of the message structure including the struct
                   IORequest header. The minimal allowable size is that
                   of a struct Message.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Pointer to a new I/O request structure or NULL if the function
     failed.



----------

CreateMsgPort()
===============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct MsgPort * CreateMsgPort();

Function

CreatePool()
============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 APTR CreatePool(
          ULONG requirements,
          IPTR puddleSize,
          IPTR threshSize );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Create a private pool for memory allocations.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     requirements - The type of the memory
     puddleSize   - The number of bytes that the pool expands by
                if it is too small.
     threshSize   - Allocations beyond the threshSize are given
                directly to the system. threshSize must be
                smaller than or equal to the puddleSize.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     A handle for the memory pool or NULL if the pool couldn't
     be created


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     \* Get the handle to a private memory pool *\
     po=CreatePool(MEMF_ANY,16384,8192);
     if(po!=NULL)
     {
         \* Use the pool *\
         UBYTE *mem1,*mem2;
         mem1=AllocPooled(po,1000);
         mem2=AllocPooled(po,2000);
         \* Do something with the memory... *\

         \* Free everything at once *\
         DeletePool(po);
     }


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Since exec.library v41.12, the implementation of pools has been
     rewritten to make use of memory protection capabilities. The
     threshSize parameter is effectively ignored and is present only
     for backwards compatibility.

Disable()
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void Disable();

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     This function will prevent interrupts from occuring (*). You can
     start the interrupts again with a call to Enable().

     Note that calls to Disable() nest, and for every call to
     Disable() you need a matching call to Enable().

     ***** WARNING *****

     Using this function is considered very harmful, and it should only
     ever be used to protect data that could also be accessed in interrupts.

     It is quite possible to either crash the system, or to prevent
     normal activities (disk/port i/o) from occuring.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Interrupts will be disabled AFTER this call returns.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     In most userspace code, you will not want to use this function.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function preserves all registers.

     To prevent deadlocks calling Wait() in disabled state breaks
     the disable - thus interrupts may happen again.

     As the schedulers pre-emption is interrupt driven,
     this function has the side effect of disabling
     multitasking.

     (*) On EXECSMP builds, Disable() only aplies to the processor
         it is called from (and needs to be re-enabled there also)
         Data which needs to be protected from parallel access will
         also require a spinlock.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Sort a node into a list. The sort-key is the field node->ln_Pri.
     The node will be inserted into the list before the first node
     with lower priority. This creates a FIFO queue for nodes with
     the same priority.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     list - Insert into this list. The list has to be in descending
             order in respect to the field ln_Pri of all nodes.
     node - This node is to be inserted. Note that this has to
             be a complete node and not a MinNode !


Result
~~~~~~

     This function was private in AmigaOS(tm) up to v3.1.
     There's no guarantee that it will exist in other systems.



----------

FindName()
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct Node * FindName(
          struct List * list,
          CONST_STRPTR name );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Look for a node with a certain name in a list.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     list - Search this list.
     name - This is the name to look for.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     struct List * list;
     struct Node * node;

     // Look for a node with the name "Hello"
     node = FindName (list, "Hello");


Notes
~~~~~
::

     The search is case-sensitive, so "Hello" will not find a node
     named "hello".

     The list must contain complete Nodes and no MinNodes.

     When supplied with a NULL list argument, defaults to the exec port list.



----------

FindPort()
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct MsgPort * FindPort(
          CONST_STRPTR name );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Look for a public messageport by name. This function doesn't
     arbitrate for the port list and must be protected with a Forbid()
     Permit() pair.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     port - Pointer to NUL terminated C string.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Pointer to struct MsgPort or NULL if there is no port of that name.



----------

FindResident()
==============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct Resident * FindResident(
          const UBYTE * name );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Search for a Resident module in the system resident list.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name - pointer to the name of a Resident module to find


Result
~~~~~~
::

     pointer to the Resident module (struct Resident *), or null if
     not found.



----------

FindSemaphore()
===============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct SignalSemaphore * FindSemaphore(
          CONST_STRPTR name );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Find a semaphore with a given name in the system global semaphore list.
     Note that this call doesn't arbitrate for the list - use Forbid() to
     do this yourself.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name - Pointer to name.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Address of semaphore structure found or NULL.



----------

FindTask()
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct Task * FindTask(
          CONST_STRPTR name );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Find a task with a given name or get the address of the current task.
     Finding the address of the current task is a very quick function
     call, but finding a special task is a very CPU intensive instruction.
     Note that generally a task may already be gone when this function
     returns.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name - Pointer to name or NULL for current task.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Address of task structure found.



----------

FindTaskByPID()
===============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct Task * FindTaskByPID(
          ULONG id );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Scan through the task lists searching for the task whose
     et_UniqueID field matches.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     id      -   The task ID to match.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Address of the Task control structure that matches, or
     NULL otherwise.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function is source-compatible with MorphOS.



----------

Forbid()
========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void Forbid();

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Forbid any further taskswitches (*) until a matching call to Permit().
     Naturally disabling taskswitches means:

     THIS CALL IS DANGEROUS

     Do not use it without thinking very well about it or better
     do not use it at all. Most of the time you can live without
     it by using semaphores or similar.

     Calls to Forbid() nest, i.e. for each call to Forbid() you
     need one call to Permit().


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     None.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The multitasking state will be disabled AFTER this function
     returns to the caller.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     On uniprocessor builds of AROS, it is generally not necessary/
     desirable to use Forbid()/Permit() in most userspace code - however for
     EXECSMP builds, you will need to protect spinlocks against
     task switches on the local processor..


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function preserves all registers.

     To prevent deadlocks calling Wait() in forbidden state breaks
     the forbid - thus taskswitches may happen again.

     (*) On EXECSMP builds, Forbid() only aplies to the processor
         it is called from. Data which needs to be protected from
         parallel access will also require a spinlock.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     The only architecture that you can rely on the registers being
     saved is on the Motorola mc68000 family.

========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct Message * GetMsg(
          struct MsgPort * port );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Get a message from a given messageport. This function doesn't wait
     and returns NULL if the messageport is empty. Therefore it's
     generally a good idea to WaitPort() or Wait() on the given port first.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     version - a version number


Notes
~~~~~

----------

InitResident()
==============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 APTR InitResident(
          struct Resident * resident,
          BPTR segList );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Test the resident structure and build the library or device
     with the information given therein. The Init() vector is
     called and the base address returned.

     The Init() vector is called with the following registers:
             D0 = 0
             A0 = segList
             A6 = ExecBase


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     resident - Pointer to resident structure.
     segList  - Pointer to loaded module, 0 for resident modules.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     A pointer returned from the Init() vector. Usually this is the
     base of the library/device/resource. NULL for failure.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     AUTOINIT modules are automatically added to the correct exec list.
     Non AUTOINIT modules have to do all the work themselves.



----------

InitSemaphore()
===============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void InitSemaphore(
          struct SignalSemaphore * sigSem );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Prepares a semaphore structure for use by the exec semaphore system,

     before using it or the semaphore functions will fail.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     sigSem - Pointer to semaphore structure


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Semaphores are shared between the tasks that use them and must
     therefore lie in public (or at least shared) memory.



----------

InitStruct()
============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void InitStruct(
          CONST_APTR initTable,
          APTR memory,
          ULONG size );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Initialize some library base or other structure depending on the
     information in the init table. The init table consists of
     instructions starting with an action byte followed by more
     information. The instruction byte looks like:

     iisscccc where ii is the instruction code:
                       0 - copy following c+1 elements
                       1 - repeat following element c+1 times
                       2 - take next byte as offset, then copy
                       3 - take the next 3 bytes (in the machine's
                           particular byte ordering) as offset, then
                           copy
                    ss is the element size
                       0 - LONGs
                       1 - WORDs
                       2 - BYTEs
                       3 - QUADs
                    cccc is the element count-1

     Instruction bytes must follow the same alignment restrictions as LONGs;
     the following elements are aligned to their particular restrictions.

     A 0 instruction ends the init table.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     initTable - Pointer to init table.
     memory    - Pointer to uninitialized structure.
     size      - Size of memory area to zero out before decoding or 0
                 for no filling.

Insert()
========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void Insert(
          struct List * list,
          struct Node * node,
          struct Node * pred );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Insert Node node after pred in list.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     list - The list to insert the node into
     node - This node is to be inserted
     pred - Insert after this node. If this is NULL, node is inserted
             as the first node (same as AddHead()).


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     struct List * list;
     struct Node * pred, * node;

     // Insert Node node as second node in list
     pred = GetHead (list);
     Insert (list, node, pred);

          CONST_APTR funcDispBase );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Creates the jumptable for a shared library and flushes the processor's
     instruction cache. Does not checksum the library.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     target        - The highest byte +1 of the jumptable. Typically
                     this is the library's base address.
     functionArray - Pointer to either an array of function pointers or
                     an array of WORD displacements to a given location
                     in memory. A value of -1 terminates the array in both
                     cases.
     funcDispBase  - The base location for WORD displacements or NULL
                     for function pointers.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Size of the jumptable.



----------

MakeLibrary()
=============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct Library * MakeLibrary(
          CONST_APTR funcInit,
          CONST_APTR structInit,
          ULONG_FUNC libInit,
          ULONG dataSize,
          BPTR segList );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Allocates memory for the library, builds it and calls the library's
     init vector. Generally this function is for internal use and for
     use by library programmers that don't want to use the automatic
     initialization procedure.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     funcInit   - Either a pointer to an array of function offsets
                  (starts with -1, relative to funcInit) or to an array
                  of absolute function pointers.
     structInit - Pointer to a InitStruct() data region or NULL.
     libInit    - The library's init vector or NULL.
                  The init vector is called with the library address (D0),
                  the segList (A0) and ExecBase (A6) as arguments.
                  If the init fails the init code has to free the base memory
                  and return NULL (the library address for success).
     dataSize   - Size of the library structure including system structures.
                  Must be at least sizeof(struct Library).
     segList    - BCPL pointer to the library segments. Used to free the
                  library later.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The library base address or NULL.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     The library base is always aligned to the maximum of sizeof(LONG)
     and double alignment restrictions.

          struct Task * task,
          APTR initialPC,
          APTR finalPC,
          TAG tag, ... );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Add a new task to the system. If the new task has the highest
     priority of all and task switches are allowed it will be started
     immediately.
     Certain task fields should be intitialized and a stack must be
     allocated before calling this function. tc_SPReg will be used as the
     starting location for the stack pointer, i.e. a part of the stack can
     be reserved to pass the task some initial arguments.
     Memory can be added to the tc_MemEntry list and will be freed when the
     task dies. The new task's registers are set to 0.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     task      - Pointer to task structure.
     initialPC - Entry point for the new task.
     finalPC   - Routine that is called if the initialPC() function returns.
                 A NULL pointer installs the default finalizer.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The address of the new task or NULL if the operation failed (can only
     happen with TF_ETASK set - currenty not implemented).


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function is private. Use MorphOS-compatible NewCreateTaskA()
     in your applications.

::

     Allocate a number of memory blocks through a MemList structure.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     entry        - The MemList with one MemEntry for each block you want to get
     return_entry - Pointer to struct MemList *variable where the address
                    of the MemList allocated by this function will be stored.
     return_flags - Pointer to ULONG variable where upon failure the type of
                    memory that could not be allocated is stored. You may pass
                    NULL here.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Address of the allocated MemList if the allocation was successful. In this
     case *return_flags will be set to 0.

     NULL if the allocation failed. In this case *return_flags will contain the
     type of memory that couldn't be allocated.

ObtainSemaphoreList()
=====================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void ObtainSemaphoreList(
          struct List * sigSem );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     This function takes a list of semaphores and locks all of them at
     once. It is only possible for one task to attempt to lock all the
     semaphores at once (since it uses the ss_MultipleLink field), so
     you will need to protect the entire list (with another semaphore
     perhaps?).

     If somebody attempts to lock more than one semaphore on this list
     with ObtainSemaphore() it is possible for a deadlock to occur due
     to two tasks waiting for a semaphore that the other has obtained.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     sigSem - pointer to list full of semaphores


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The entire semaphore list will be locked.



----------

ObtainSemaphoreShared()
=======================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void ObtainSemaphoreShared(
          struct SignalSemaphore * sigSem );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Get a shared lock on a semaphore. If the lock cannot be obtained
     immediately this function waits. There may be more than one shared
     locks at the same time but only one exclusive one. An exclusive
     lock prevents shared locks. Shared locks are released with
     ReleaseSemaphore().


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     sigSem - Pointer to semaphore structure

     This function preserves all registers.

OpenDevice()
============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG OpenDevice(
          CONST_STRPTR devName,
          IPTR unitNumber,
          struct IORequest * iORequest,
          ULONG flags );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Tries to open a device and fill the iORequest structure.  An error
     is returned if this fails, 0 if all went well.

     If the device doesn't exist in the current system device list, then
     first the system ROMtag module list, then if the DOS is running,
     then the DEVS: directory will be tried.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     devName    - Pointer to the devices's name.
     unitNumber - The unit number. Most often 0. In some special cases this can be
                  a pointer to something (device-dependent).
     iORequest  - Pointer to device specific information.
                  Will be filled out by the device.
                  Must lie in public (or at least shared) memory.
     flags      - Some flags to give to the device.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Error code or 0 if all went well. The same value can be found
     in the io_Error field.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Return type is internally extended to LONG in all existing official ROMs
     (EXT.W D0 + EXT.L D0) DoIO() and WaitIO() do the same.
     Many programs assume LONG return code, even some WB utilities.

OpenLibrary()
=============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct Library * OpenLibrary(
          CONST_STRPTR libName,

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Opens a library given by name and revision. If the library does not
     exist in the current system shared library list, the first the
     system ROMTag module list is tried. If this fails, and the DOS is
     running, then the library will be loaded from disk.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     libName - Pointer to the library's name.
     version - the library's version number.

Permit()
========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void Permit();

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     This function will reactivate the task dispatcher (*) after a call
     to Forbid(). Note that calls to Forbid() nest, and for every
     call to Forbid() you need a matching call to Permit().


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     None.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Multitasking will be re-enabled.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     On uniprocessor builds of AROS, it is generally not necessary/
     desirable to use Forbid()/Permit() in most userspace code - however for
     EXECSMP builds, you will need to protect spinlocks against
     task switches on the local processor..


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function preserves all registers.

     To prevent deadlocks calling Wait() in forbidden state breaks
     the forbid - thus taskswitches may happen again.

     (*) On EXECSMP builds, Forbid() only aplies to the processor
         it is called from. Data which needs to be protected from
         parallel access will also require a spinlock.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     The only architecture that you can rely on the registers being
     saved is on the Motorola mc68000 family.

Procure()
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 ULONG Procure(

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Tries to get a lock on a semaphore in an asynchronous manner.
     If the semaphore is not free this function will not wait but
     just post a request to the semaphore. As soon as the semaphore is
     available the bidMsg will return and make you owner of the semaphore.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     sigSem - pointer to semaphore structure
     bidMsg - pointer to a struct SemaphoreMessage. This should lie in
              public or at least shared memory.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Principly none. Don't know. Just ignore it.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Locks obtained with Procure() must be released with Vacate().

PutMsg()
========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void PutMsg(
          struct MsgPort * port,
          struct Message * message );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Sends a message to a given message port. Messages are not copied
     from one task to another but must lie in shared memory instead.
     Therefore the owner of the message may generally not reuse it before
     it is returned. But this depends on the two tasks sharing the message.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     port    - Pointer to messageport.
     message - Pointer to message.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     It is legal to send a message from within interrupts.

     Messages may either trigger a signal at the owner of the messageport
     or raise a software interrupt, depending on port->mp_Flags&PF_ACTION.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     printf-style formatting function with callback hook.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     FormatString - Pointer to the format string with any of the following
                    DataStream formatting options allowed:

                    %[leftalign][minwidth.][maxwidth][size][type]

                    leftalign - '-' means align left. Default: align right.
                    minwidth  - minimum width of field. Defaults to 0.
                    maxwidth  - maximum width of field (for strings only).
                                Defaults to no limit.

                    size      - 'l' means LONG. 'll' or 'L' means QUAD
                                (AROS extension). Defaults to WORD, if
                                nothing is specified.

                    type      - 'b' BSTR. It will use the internal representation
                                    of the BSTR defined by the ABI.
                                'c' single character.
                                'd' signed decimal number.
                                's' C string. NULL terminated.
                                'u' unsigned decimal number.
                                'x' unsigned hexadecimal number.
                                'P' pointer. Size depends on the architecture.
                                'p' The same as 'P', for AmigaOS v4 compatibility.

     DataStream   - Pointer to a zone of memory containing the data. Data has to be
                    WORD aligned.

     PutChProc    - Callback function. Called for each character, including
                    the NULL terminator. The fuction is called as follows:

                    AROS_UFC2(void, PutChProc,
                              AROS_UFCA(UBYTE, char,      D0),
                              AROS_UFCA(APTR , PutChData, A3));
                 
                    Additionally, PutChProc can be set to one of the following
                    magic values:

                      RAWFMTFUNC_STRING - Write output to string buffer pointed
                                          to by PutChData which is incremented
                                          every character.
                      RAWFMTFUNC_SERIAL - Write output to debug output. PutChData
                                          is ignored and not touched.
                      RAWFMTFUNC_COUNT  - Count number of characters in the result.
                                          PutChData is a pointer to ULONG which
                                          is incremented every character. Initial
                                          value of the counter is kept as it is.

                    If you want to be compatible with AmigaOS you
                    should check that exec.library has at least version 45.

     PutChData    - Data propagated to each call of the callback hook.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Pointer to the rest of the DataStream.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     Build a sprintf style function:

         void my_sprintf(UBYTE *buffer, UBYTE *format, ...);

         static void callback(UBYTE chr __reg(d0), UBYTE **data __reg(a3))
         {
            *(*data)++=chr;
         }

         void my_sprintf(UBYTE *buffer, UBYTE *format, ...)
         {
             AROS_SLOWSTACKFORMAT_PRE(format)
             RawDoFmt(format, AROS_SLOWSTACKFORMAT_ARG(format), &callback, &buffer);
             AROS_SLOWSTACKFORMAT_POST(format)
         }

     The above example uses AROS_SLOWSTACKFORMAT_* macros in the function
     in order to make sure that arguments are all passed on
     the stack on all architectures. The alternative is to use
     VNewRawDoFmt() function which takes va_list instead of array
     DataStream.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     The field size defaults to WORD which may be different from the
     default integer size of the compiler. If you don't take care about
     this the result will be messy.
     
     There are different solutions for GCC:
     - Define Datastream between #pragma pack(2) / #pragma pack().
     - Use __attribute__((packed)) for Datastream.
     - Only use type of LONG/ULONG for integer variables. Additionally only use
       %ld/%lu in FormatString.

::

     PutChData cannot be modified from the callback hook on non-m68k
     systems.

     While it's more or less safe to patch a library vector with
     SetFunction() it's not possible to safely remove the patch later.
     So don't use this function if it can be avoided.

SetSR()
=======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 ULONG SetSR(
          ULONG newSR,
          ULONG mask );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Read/Modify the CPU status register in an easy way. Only the bits
     set it the mask parameter will be changed.

     The bits in the register mapped to those of the Motorola MC680x0
     family of microprocessors.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     newSR   -   The new contents of the status register.
     mask    -   Mask of bits to change.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The old contents of the status register or ~0UL if this function
     is not implemented.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     You can read the status register by calling SetSR(0,0).


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function is of limited use.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     This function may do nothing on non-mc680x0 systems.

SetTaskPri()
============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BYTE SetTaskPri(
          struct Task * task,
          LONG priority );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Change the priority of a given task. As a general rule the higher
     the priority the more CPU time a task gets. Useful values are within
     -127 to 5.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     task     - Pointer to task structure.
     priority - New priority of the task.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Old task priority.



----------

ShutdownA()
===========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 ULONG ShutdownA(
          ULONG action );
 
 ULONG Shutdown(
          TAG tag, ... );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     This function attempts to shut down registered handlers
     before rebooting the system, or entering a powered off state.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     action - which process to perform:
      * SD_ACTION_POWEROFF   - power off/halt the hardware.
      * SD_ACTION_COLDREBOOT - cold reboot the hardware.
      * SD_ACTION_WARMREBOOT - soft reboot the operating system.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     This function does not return in case of success. Otherwise it returns
     zero.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     It can be quite harmful to call this function. It may be possible that
     you will lose data from other tasks not having saved, or disk buffers
     not being flushed. Plus you could annoy the (other) users.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Send some signals to a given task. If the task is currently waiting
     on these signals, has a higher priority as the current one and if
     taskswitches are allowed the new task begins to run immediately.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     task      - Pointer to task structure.
     signalSet - The set of signals to send to the task.


Notes

StackSwap()
===========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void StackSwap(
          struct StackSwapStruct * sss );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Changes the stack used by a task. The StackSwapStruct will contain
     the value of the old stack such that the stack can be reset to the
     previous version by another call to StackSwap().

     When the stack is swapped, the data on the stack(s) will not be
     altered, so the stack may not be set up for you. It is generally
     required that you replace your stack before exiting from the
     current stack frame (procedure, function call etc.).


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     sss     -   A structure containing the values for the upper, lower
                 and current bounds of the stack you wish to use. The
                 values will be replaced by the current values and you
                 can restore the values later.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The program will be running on a new stack and sss will contain
     the old stack.

     Calling StackSwap() twice consecutively will effectively do
     nothing.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Returning from the function that you call StackSwap() in can have
     unexpected results.

     Use of StackSwap() is deprecated on AROS; NewStackSwap() should
     be used instead. StackSwap() is only retained to provide backwards
     compatibility. On some hosted versions with strict stack checking use
     of StackSwap() may cause problems.
     By default StackSwap() will not be defined and you have to
     #define __AROS_GIMME_DEPRECATED_STACKSWAP__ before including
     <proto/exec.h>. As said above it is highly advised to change code
     to use NewStackSwap() and not define __AROS_GIMME_DEPRECATED_STACKSWAP__

SumLibrary()
============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void SumLibrary(
          struct Library * library );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Builds the checksum over a given library's jumptable and either puts
     it into the library->lib_Sum field (if the library is marked as changed)
     or compares it with this field and Alert()s at mismatch.

SuperState()
============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 APTR SuperState();

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Enter supervisor mode (like Supervisor()), but return on the user
     stack. This will mean that the user stack variables are still there.
     A call to UserState() will end this mode.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     None.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The old supervisor stack. This must be passed to UserState(). If the
     processor was already in supervisor mode, then this function will
     return NULL. In that case do NOT call UserState().


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This is not a good function to use, it has limited scope, and will
     probably be even less useful in the future.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     You can easily cause your system to cease operating normally.

----------

Supervisor()
============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 IPTR Supervisor(
          void * userFunction );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Supervisor will allow a short privileged instruction sequence to
     be called from user mode. This has very few uses, and it is probably
     better to use any system supplied method to do anything.

     The function supplied will be called as if it was a system interrupt,
     notably this means that you must *NOT* make any system calls or
     use any system data structures, and on certain systems you must
     use special methods to leave the code.

     The code will not be passed any parameters. However it has access to all
     CPU registers.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     userFunction -  The address of the code you want called in supervisor
                     mode.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The code will be called.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     On some architectures this function is impossible or infeasible to implement.
     In this case it throws a recoverable alert.

     Currently this function works only on x86 and PowerPC native kickstarts.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     You can very easily make the system unusable with this function.
     In fact it is recommended that you do not use it at all.

Result
~~~~~~
::

TypeOfMem()
===========

Synopsis

     there.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     address - Address to test


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The memory flags you would give to AllocMem().



----------

UserState()
===========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     sysStack    -   The return value from SuperState()


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The system will be back to normal.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Release a lock obtained with Procure. This will even work if the
     message is not yet replied - the request will be cancelled and the
     message replied. In any case the ssm_Semaphore field will be set to
     NULL.

VNewRawDoFmt()
==============

Synopsis

::

 STRPTR VNewRawDoFmt(
          CONST_STRPTR FormatString,
          VOID_FUNC PutChProc,
          APTR PutChData,
          va_list DataStream );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     printf-style formatting function with callback hook and C-style
     DataStream.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     FormatString - Pointer to the format string with any of the following
                    DataStream formatting options allowed:

                    %[leftalign][minwidth.][maxwidth][size][type]

                    leftalign - '-' means align left. Default: align right.
                    minwidth  - minimum width of field. Defaults to 0.
                    maxwidth  - maximum width of field (for strings only).
                                Defaults to no limit.

                    size      - 'l' can be used, but effectively ignored for
                                backwards compatibility with original RawDoFmt().
                                In C arguments are always at least int-sized.

                    type      - 'b' BSTR. It will use the internal representation
                                    of the BSTR defined by the ABI.
                                'c' single character.
                                'd' signed decimal number.
                                's' C string. NULL terminated.
                                'u' unsigned decimal number.
                                'x' unsigned hexdecimal number.
                                'P' pointer. Size depends on the architecture.
                                'p' The same as 'P', for AmigaOS v4 compatibility.

     PutChProc    - Callback function. Called for each character, including
                    the NULL terminator. The function should be declared as
                    follows:

                    APTR PutChProc(APTR PutChData, UBYTE char);

                    The function should return new value for PutChData variable.

                    Additionally, PutChProc can be set to one of the following
                    magic values:

                      RAWFMTFUNC_STRING - Write output to string buffer pointed
                                          to by PutChData which is incremented
                                          every character.
                      RAWFMTFUNC_SERIAL - Write output to debug output. PutChData
                                          is ignored and not touched.
                      RAWFMTFUNC_COUNT  - Count number of characters in the result.
                                          PutChData is a pointer to ULONG which
                                          is incremented every character. Initial
                                          value of the counter is kept as it is.

     PutChData    - Data propagated to each call of the callback hook.

     DataStream   - C-style data stream (va_list variable)


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Final PutChData value.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     Build a sprintf style function:

         void my_sprintf(UBYTE *buffer, UBYTE *format, ...)
         {
             va_list args;
             
             va_start(args, format);

Wait()
======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 ULONG Wait(
          ULONG signalSet );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Wait until some signals are sent to the current task. If any signal
     of the specified set is already set when entering this function it
     returns immediately. Since almost any event in the OS can send a
     signal to your task if you specify it to do so signals are a very
     powerful mechanism.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     signalSet - The set of signals to wait for.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The set of active signals.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Naturally it's not allowed to wait in supervisor mode.

     Calling Wait() breaks an active Disable() or Forbid().

WaitIO()
========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG WaitIO(
          struct IORequest * iORequest );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Waits until the I/O request is completed and removes it from the
     reply port. If the message is already done when calling this function,
     it doesn't wait but just removes the message.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     iORequest - Pointer to iorequest structure.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Error state of I/O request.


Notes
~~~~~

WaitPort()
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct Message * WaitPort(
          struct MsgPort * port );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Wait until a message arrives at the given port. If there is already
     a message in it this function returns immediately.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     port    - Pointer to messageport.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Pointer to the first message that arrived at the port. The message
     is _not_ removed from the port. GetMsg() does this for you.
