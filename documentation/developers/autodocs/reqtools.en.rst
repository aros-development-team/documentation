rtAllocRequestA()
=================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 APTR rtAllocRequestA(
          ULONG type,
          struct TagItem * taglist );
 
 APTR rtAllocRequest(
          ULONG type,
          TAG tag, ... );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Allocates a requester structure for you in a future compatible
     manner. This is the only way to properly allocate a rtFileRequester,
     rtFontRequester, rtReqInfo or rtScreenModeRequester structure. The
     structure will be initialized for you.

     Use rtFreeRequest() to free the requester structure when you no
     longer need it.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     type    - type of structure to allocate, currently RT_REQINFO,
         RT_FILEREQ, RT_FONTREQ or RT_SCREENMODEREQ.
     taglist - pointer to array of tags (currently always NULL).


Tags

::

     no tags defined yet
     

Result
~~~~~~
::

     req - pointer to the requester allocated or NULL if no memory.

rtChangeReqAttrA()
==================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG rtChangeReqAttrA(
          APTR req,
          struct TagItem * taglist );
 
 LONG rtChangeReqAttr(
          APTR req,
          TAG tag, ... );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Change requester attributes with supplied taglist. This is the only
     correct way to change the attributes listed below.

     The return code from rtChangeReqAttrA() should be ignored unless
     stated otherwise.

     Don't pass the tags listed below to the requester itself (unless
     documented otherwise). They will not be recognized.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     req     - pointer to requester.
     taglist - pointer to array of tags.


Tags
~~~~
::

     For the file requester:

     RTFI_Dir - (char *)
         Name of new directory to position file requester in. The
         requester's buffer will be deallocated.

     RTFI_MatchPat - (char *) New pattern string to match files on.

     RTFI_AddEntry - (BPTR) THIS *MUST* BE THE LAST TAGÂ (just before
         TAG_END)! Tagdata must hold a lock on a file or directory you
         want to add to the file requester's buffer. The lock should
         have been obtained using Lock(), and you must unlock this lock
         yourself. It is your responsibility to make sure the file or
         directory is indeed in the directory the file requester is in.
         If the entry is already in the file requester's buffer it will
         simply be updated.
         It is harmless to use this tag if the requester's buffer is not
         initialized. rtChangeReqAttr() will return a boolean to
         indicate success or failure (out of memory).

     RTFI_RemoveEntry - (char *) Name of file or directory you want to
         remove from the file requester's buffer. It is your
         responsibility to make sure the file or directory is indeed in
         the directory the file requester is in.
         It is harmless use this tag if the requester's buffer is not
         initialized.

     For the font requester:

     RTFO_FontName - (char *) Set the name of the currently selected
         font.

     RTFO_FontHeight - (UWORD) Set the fontsize of the currently
         selected font.

     RTFO_FontStyle - (UBYTE) Set the style of the current font.

     RTFO_FontFlags - (UBYTE) Set the flags of the current font.

     For the screenmode requester [V38]:

     RTSC_ModeFromScreen - (struct Screen *) Screen to get mode
         attributes from.

         NOTE: You must make sure the mode this screen is in will be
             accepted by the screen mode requester. Otherwise it will
             automatically cancel. For example, you use
             RTDI_ModeFromScreen on a HAM screen and you haven't set the
             SCREQF_NONSTDMODES flag.
             Note that you must use this tag _before_ the four tags
             below because this tag will set the width, height, depth
             and autoscroll.

     RTSC_DisplayID - (ULONG) Set 32-bit mode id of selected mode. The
         width and height will be set to the default (visible) width and
         height, and the depth will be set to maximum. Also read note
         above. Note that you must use this tag _before_ the three tags
         below because this tag will set the width, height and depth to
         default values.

     RTSC_DisplayWidth - (UWORD) Set width of display. Must come after
         RTSC_DisplayID or RTSC_ModeFromScreen tags.

     RTSC_DisplayHeight - (UWORD) Set height of display. Must come after
         RTSC_DisplayID or RTSC_ModeFromScreen tags.

     RTSC_DisplayDepth - (UWORD) Set depth of display. Must come after
         RTSC_DisplayID or RTSC_ModeFromScreen tags.

     RTSC_AutoScroll - (BOOL) Boolean state of autoscroll checkbox. Must
         come after RTSC_ModeFromScreen tag.

     RTSC_OverscanType - (ULONG) Set type of overscan. Set to 0 for
         regular size, otherwise use OSCAN_... constants. See
         'intuition/screens.[h|i]'.

rtCloseWindowSafely()
=====================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 VOID rtCloseWindowSafely(
          struct Window * window );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::


     Closes a window which shares its IDCMP port with another window.  All the
     pending messages (concerning this window) on the port will be removed and
     the window will be closed.

     Do not use this function to close windows which have an IDCMP port set up
     by Intuition.  If you do the port will be left in memory!

     If you intend to open a lot of windows all sharing the same IDCMP port it
     is easiest if you create a port yourself and open all windows with
     newwin.IDCMPFlags set to 0 (this tells Intuition to NOT set up an IDCMP
     port).  After opening the window set the win->UserPort to your message
     port and call ModifyIDCMP to set your IDCMP flags.

     When you then receive messages from intuition check the imsg->IDCMPWindow
     field to find out what window they came from and act upon them.

     When closing your windows call rtCloseWindowSafely() for all of them and
     delete your message port.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::


     window  --  pointer to the window to be closed


Notes
~~~~~
::


     This function is for the advanced ReqTools user.

rtEZRequestA()
==============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 ULONG rtEZRequestA(
          char * bodyfmt,
          char * gadfmt,
          struct rtReqInfo * reqinfo,
          APTR argarray,
          struct TagItem * taglist );
 
 ULONG rtEZRequest(
          char * bodyfmt,
          char * gadfmt,
          struct rtReqInfo * reqinfo,
          APTR argarray,
          TAG tag, ... );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     This function puts up a requester for you and waits for a response
     from the user. If the response is positive, this procedure returns
     TRUE. If the response is negative, this procedure returns FALSE.
     The function may also return an IDCMP flag or a value corresponding
     with one of other possible responses (see below).

     'gadfmt' may contain several possible responses. Separate these
     responses by a '|'. For example: "Yes|No", or 'Yes|Maybe|No". The
     responses should be typed in the same order as they will appear on
     screen, from left to right. There is no limit to the number of
     responses other than the width of the screen the requester will
     appear on.

     'bodyfmt' can contain newlines ('\n', ASCII 10). This will cause a
     new line to be started (surprise, surprise :-).
     You may also include printf() style formatting codes. The format
     arguments should be pointed to by 'argarray'.
     You can use formatting codes in 'gadfmt' as well. The arguments for
     this format string should follow the ones for 'bodyfmt'.

     NOTE: The formatting is done by exec.library/RawDoFmt(), so be
         aware that to display a 32-bit integer argument you must use
         "%ld", not "%d", since RawDoFmt() is "word-oriented."

     The second and third function use a variable number of arguments.
     These functions can be found in 'reqtools[nb].lib'.
     The second function has the RawDoFmt() arguments as variable args,
     the third the tags. If you need both this is what you can do:

     ...
     {
        ULONG tags[] = { RTEZ_ReqTitle, (ULONG)"mytitle", TAG_END };

        rtEZRequest ("String, num: %s, %ld", "Ok", NULL,
                                        (struct TagItem *)tags, "six", 6);
     }
     ...

     You can satisfy the requester with the following keyboard shortcuts:
         'Y' or Left Amiga 'V' for a positive response,
         ESC, 'N', 'R' or Left Amiga 'B' for a negative response.

     If EZREQF_NORETURNKEY is _not_ set (see RTEZ_Flags below) the
     RETURN key is also accepted as a shortcut for the positive response
     (can be changed using RTEZ_DefaultResponse, see below). The
     response that will be selected when you press RETURN will be
     printed in bold.

     The EZREQF_LAMIGAQUAL flag should be used when you put up a
     requester for a destructive action (e.g. to delete something). When
     it is set the keyboard shortcuts are limited to Left Amiga 'V' and
     'B' so it is harder to accidently select something you will regret.
     Note that the RETURN and ESC key remain active!  To disable the
     RETURN key use the EZREQF_NORETURNKEY flag. The ESC key cannot be
     disabled.

     You may pass a NULL for 'gadfmt', but make sure you know what you
     are doing. Passing a NULL opens an EZRequester with NO responses,
     just a body text. This implies the user has no means of "answering"
     this requester. You must therefore use the RT_IDCMPFlags tag to
     allow some other events to end the requester (e.g.
     IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS, IDCMP_INACTIVEWINDOW,...) or you must make use
     of the ReqHandler feature. Using a requester handler you can end
     the requester by program control. This way you can e.g. put up a
     requester before you start loading a file and remove it after the
     file has been loaded. Do not pass an empty string as 'gadfmt'!

     'reqinfo' can be used to customize the requester. For greater
     control use the tags listed below. The advantage of the rtReqInfo
     structure is that it is global, where tags have to be specified
     each function call. See libraries/reqtools.[hi] for a description
     of the rtReqInfo structure.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     bodyfmt  - requester body text, can be format string a la RawDoFmt().
     gadfmt   - text for gadgets (left to right, separated by '|') or NULL.
     argarray - pointer to array of arguments for format string(s).
                nb - : arguments must be handled the same as for RawDoFmt!
                use aros slowstack macros.
     reqinfo  - pointer to a rtReqInfo structure allocated with
         rtAllocRequest() or NULL.
     taglist  - pointer to a TagItem array.


Tags

::

     RT_Window - (struct Window *) Window that will be used to find the
         screen to put the requester on. You *MUST* supply this if you
         are a task calling this function and not a process! This is
         because tasks don't have a pr_WindowPtr.

     RT_IDCMPFlags - (ULONG) Extra idcmp flags to return on. If one
         these IDCMP flags causes the requester to abort the return code
         will equal the flag in question.

     RT_ReqPos - (ULONG) One of the following:

         REQPOS_POINTER - requester appears where the mouse pointer is
             (default).

         REQPOS_CENTERSCR - requester is centered on the screen.

         REQPOS_CENTERWIN - requester is centered in the window (only
             works if the pr_WindowPtr of your process is valid or if you
             use RT_Window). If RT_Window is NULL the requester will be
             centered on the screen.

         REQPOS_TOPLEFTSCR - requester appears at the top left of the
             screen.

         REQPOS_TOPLEFTWIN - requester appears at the top left of the
             window (only works if the pr_WindowPtr of your process is
             valid or if you use RT_Window).
         
         The requester will always remain in the visible part of the
         screen, so if you use the Workbench 2.0 ScreenMode preferences
         editor to enlarge your Workbench screen and you scroll around,
         the requester will always appear in the part you can see.
         REQPOS_CENTERSCR and REQPOS_TOPLEFTSCR also apply to the
         visible part of the screen. So if you use one of these the
         requester will be appear in the center or the top left off what
         you can see of the screen as opposed to the entire screen.
         
         REQPOS_CENTERWIN and REQPOS_TOPLEFTWIN fall back to
         REQPOS_CENTERSCR or REQPOS_TOPLEFTSCR respectively when there
         is no parent window. So you can safely use these without
         worrying about the existence of a window.

     RT_LeftOffset - (ULONG) Offset of left edge of requester relative to
         position specified with RT_ReqPos (does not offset the
         requester when RT_ReqPos is REQPOS_POINTER).

     RT_TopOffset - (ULONG) Offset of top edge of requester relative to
         position specified with RT_ReqPos (does not offset the
         requester when RT_ReqPos is REQPOS_POINTER).

     RT_PubScrName - (char *) Name of public screen requester should
         appear on. When this tag is used the RT_Window tag will be
         ignored. If the public screen is not found the requester will
         open on the default public screen.
         
         Only works on Kickstart 2.0! reqtools.library does not check
         this, it is up to you *NOT* to use this tag on Kickstart 1.3 or
         below! Note that the 1.3 version of reqtools.library also
         understands and supports this tag (on 2.0).

     RT_Screen - (struct Screen *) Address of screen to put requester
         on. You should never use this, use RT_Window or RT_PubScrName.

     RT_ReqHandler - (struct rtHandlerInfo **) Using this tag you can
         start an "asynchronous" requester. ti_TagData of the tag must
         hold the address of a pointer variable to a rtHandlerInfo
         structure. The requester will initialize this pointer and will
         return immediately after its normal initialization. The return
         code will not be what you would normally expect. If the return
         code is _not_ equal to CALL_HANDLER an error occurred and you
         should take appropriate steps.
         
         If the return code was CALL_HANDLER everything went ok and the
         requester will still be up! See the explanation for
         rtReqHandlerA() below for the following steps you have to take.

     RT_WaitPointer - (BOOL) If this is TRUE the window calling the
         requester will get a standard wait pointer set while the
         requester is up. This will happen if you used the RT_Window tag
         or if your process's pr_WindowPtr is valid. Note that after the
         requester has finished your window will be ClearPointer()-ed.
         
         If you used a custom pointer in your window you will have to
         re-set it, or not use the RT_WaitPointer tag and put up a wait
         pointer yourself. If your program requires ReqTools V38 it is
         advised you use RT_LockWindow instead. Defaults to FALSE.

     RT_LockWindow - (BOOL) [V38] If this is TRUE the window calling the
         requester will get locked. It will no longer accept any user
         input and it will get standard wait pointer set. This will
         happen only if you used the RT_Window tag or if your process's
         pr_WindowPtr is valid. RT_LockWindow will restore a custom
         pointer if you have used one (unlike RT_WaitPointer). So you do
         not have to worry about having to restore it yourself. It is
         advised you use this tag as much as possible. Defaults to FALSE.

         Under Kickstart V39 the original window pointer will not be
         restored if it was set using SetWindowPointer(). You will have
         to restore the pointer yourself in this case.

     RT_ScreenToFront - (BOOL) [V38] Boolean indicating whether to pop
         the screen the requester will appear on to the front. Default is
         TRUE.

     RT_ShareIDCMP - (BOOL) [V38] Boolean indicating whether to share
         the IDCMP port of the parent window. Use this tag together with
         the RT_Window tag to indicate the window to share IDCMP with.
         Sharing the IDCMP port produces less overhead, so it is advised
         you use this tag. Defaults to FALSE.

     RT_Locale - (struct Locale *) [V38] Locale to determine what
         language to use for the requester text. If this tag is not used
         or its data is NULL, the system's current default locale will
         be used. Default NULL.
     RT_IntuiMsgFunc - (struct Hook *) [V38] The requester will call
         this hook for each IDCMP message it gets that doesn't belong to
         its window. Only applies if you used the RT_ShareIDCMP tag to
         share the IDCMP port with the parent window. Parameters are as
         follows:
         
             A0 - (struct Hook *) your hook
             A2 - (struct rtReqInfo *) your requester info
             A1 - (struct IntuiMessage *) the message
         
         After you have finished examining the message and your hook
         returns, ReqTools will reply the message. So do not reply the
         message yourself!

     RT_Underscore - (char) [V38] Indicates the symbol that precedes the
         character in the gadget label to be underscored. This is to
         define a keyboard shortcut for this gadget. Example: to define
         the key 'Q' as a keyboard shortcut for "Quit" and 'N' for "Oh,
         No!" you would use the tag RT_Underscore, '_' and pass as
         gadfmt "_Quit|Oh, _No!". Do not use the symbol '%' as it is
         used for string formatting. The usual character to use is '_'
         like in the example.
         
         IMPORTANT: the shortcuts defined using RT_Underscore take
             precedence of the default shortcuts! It is for example not
             wise to use a 'N' for a positive response! Pick your
             shortcuts carefully!

     RT_TextAttr - (struct TextAttr *) [V38] Use this font for the
         requester. Default is to use the screen font. Note that the
         font must already be opened by you. ReqTools will call
         OpenFont() on this TextAttr, _not_ OpenDiskFont()!  If the font
         cannot be opened using OpenFont() the default screen font will
         be used.

     RTEZ_ReqTitle - (char *) Title of requester window, default is
         "Request" unless the requester has less than 2 responses, then
         the default title is "Information".

     RTEZ_Flags - (ULONG) Flags for rtEZRequestA():

         EZREQF_NORETURNKEY - turn off the RETURN key as shortcut for
             positive response.

         EZREQF_LAMIGAQUAL - keyboard shortcuts are limited to Left
             Amiga 'V' and 'B', ESC and RETURN.

         EZREQF_CENTERTEXT - centers each line of body text in the
             requester window. Useful for about requesters.

     RTEZ_DefaultResponse - (ULONG) Response value that will be returned
         when the user presses the return key. Will be ignored if the
         EZREQF_NORETURNKEY flag is set. The text for this response will
         be printed in bold. Default is 1.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     ret - 1 (TRUE) for leftmost (positive) response, then each
         consecutive response will return 1 more, the rightmost (false)
         response will return 0 (FALSE), so 1,2,3,...,num-1,0 -- or
         idcmp flag.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Automatically adjusts the requester to the screen font.

     rtEZRequestA() checks the pr_WindowPtr of your process to find the
     screen to put the requester on.

rtFileRequestA()
================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 APTR rtFileRequestA(
          struct rtFileRequester * filereq,
          char * file,
          char * title,
          struct TagItem * taglist );
 
 APTR rtFileRequest(
          struct rtFileRequester * filereq,
          char * file,
          char * title,
          TAG tag, ... );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Get a directory and filename(s), or just a directory from the user.

     'filename' should point to an array of at least 108 chars. The
     filename already in 'filename' will be displayed in the requester
     when it comes up. When the requester returns 'filename' will
     probably have changed.

     Using certain tags may result in the calling of a caller-supplied
     hook.

     The hook will be called with A0 holding the address of your hook
     structure (you may use the h_Data field to your own liking), A2 a
     pointer to the requester structure calling the hook ('req') and A1
     a pointer to an object. The object is variable and depends on what
     your hook is for.

     This is an example of a hook suitable to be used with the
     RTFI_FilterFunc tag:

     SAS/C users can define their function thus:

     BOOL __asm __saveds filterfunc(
             register __a0 struct Hook *filterhook,
             register __a2 struct rtFileRequester *req,
             register __a1 struct FileInfoBlock *fib )
     {
         BOOL accepted = TRUE;

         // examine fib to decide if you want this file in the requester 
         ...
         return( accepted );
     }

     Your hook structure should then be initialized like this:

         filterhook->h_Entry = filterfunc;
         // in this case no need to initialize hook->h_SubEntry
         filterhook->h_Data = your_userdata_if_needed;

     You can also use a stub written in machine code to call your
     function. (see 'utility/hooks.h')


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     filereq  - pointer to a struct rtFileRequester allocated with
         rtAllocRequestA().
     filename - pointer to an array of chars (must be 108 bytes big).
     title    - pointer to requester window title (null terminated).
     taglist  - pointer to a TagItem array.

     RT_Locale - [V38] see rtEZRequestA()

     RT_IntuiMsgFunc - (struct Hook *) [V38] The requester will call
         this hook for each IDCMP message it gets that doesn't belong to
         its window. Only applies if you used the RT_ShareIDCMP tag to
         share the IDCMP port with the parent window. Parameters are as
         follows:

             A0 - (struct Hook *) your hook
             A2 - (struct rtFileRequester *) your requester
             A1 - (struct IntuiMessage *) the message

         After you have finished examining the message and your hook
         returns, ReqTools will reply the message. So do not reply the
         message yourself!

     RT_Underscore - (char) [V38] Indicates the symbol that precedes the
         character in a gadget's label to be underscored. This will also
         define the keyboard shortcut for this gadget. Currently only
         needed for RTFI_OkText. Usually set to '_'.

     RT_DefaultFont - (struct TextFont *) This tag allows you to specify
         the font to be used in the requester when the screen font is
         proportional. Default is GfxBase->DefaultFont. This tag is
         obsolete in ReqTools 2.2 and higher.

     RT_TextAttr - (struct TextAttr *) [V38] Use this font for the
         requester. Default is to use the screen font. Note that the
         font must already be opened by you. ReqTools will call
         OpenFont() on this TextAttr, _not_ OpenDiskFont()! If the font
         cannot be opened using OpenFont() or if the font is
         proportional the default screen font will be used (or the font
         set with RT_DefaultFont).

     RTFI_Flags - (ULONG) Several flags:

         FREQF_NOBUFFER - do _not_ use a buffer to remember directory
             contents for the next time the file requester is used.

         FREQF_MULTISELECT - allow multiple files to be selected.
             rtFileRequest() will return a pointer to an rtFileList
             structure which will contain all selected files. Use
             rtFreeFileList() to free the memory used by this file list.

         FREQF_SELECTDIRS - set this flag if you wish to enable the
             selecting of dirs as well as files. You *must* also set
             FREQF_MULTISELECT. Directories will be returned together
             with files in rtFileList, but with StrLen equal to -1. If
             you need the length of the directory's name use strlen().

         FREQF_SAVE - Set this if you are using the requester to save or
             delete something. Double-clicking will be disabled so it is
             harder to make a mistake and select the wrong file. If the
             user enters a non-existent directory in the drawer string
             gadget, a requester will appear asking if the directory
             should be created.

         FREQF_NOFILES - Set this if you want to use the requester to
             allow the user to select a directory rather than a file.
             Ideal for getting a destination dir. May be used with
             FREQF_MULTISELECT and FREQF_SELECTDIRS.

         FREQF_PATGAD - When this is set a pattern gadget will be added
             to the requester.

     RTFI_Height - (ULONG) Suggested height of file requester window.

     RTFI_OkText - (char *) Replacement text for "Ok" gadget, max 6
         chars long.

     RTFI_VolumeRequest - (ULONG) [V38] The presence of this tag turns
         the file requester into a volume/assign disk requester. This
         requester can be used to get a device name ("DF0:", "DH1:",..)
         or an assign ("C:", "FONTS:",...) from the user. The result of
         this requester can be found in the filereq->Dir field. The
         volume can also be changed with rtChangeReqAttrA() and the
         RTFI_Dir tag. 

         Note that the user may edit the disk/assign, or enter a new
         one. Note also that the real device name is returned, not the
         name of the volume in the device. For example "DH1:", not
         "Hard1:". The tag data (ULONG) is used to set following flags:

         VREQF_NOASSIGNS - Do not include the assigns in the list, only
             the real devices.

         VREQF_NODISKS - Do not include devices, just show the assigns.

         VREQF_ALLDISKS - Show _all_ devices. Default behavior is to
             show only those devices which have valid disks inserted
             into them. So if you have no disk in drive DF0: it will not
             show up. Set this flag if you do want these devices
             included.

         NOTE: Do *NOT* use { RTFI_VolumeRequest, TRUE }! You are then
             setting the VREQF_NOASSIGNS flag! Use { RTFI_VolumeRequest,
             0 } for a normal volume requester.

         NOTE: If you use the RTFI_FilterFunc described below the third
             parameter will be a pointer to a rtVolumeEntry structure
             rather than a pointer to a FileInfoBlock structure! Tech
             note: the DOS device list has been unlocked, so it is safe
             to e.g. Lock() this device and call Info() on this lock.

         NOTE: A file requester structure allocated with
             rtAllocRequest() should not be used for both a file and a
             volume requester. Allocate two requester structures if you
             need both a file and a volume requester in your program!

     RTFI_FilterFunc - (struct Hook *) [V38] Call this hook for each
         file and directory in the directory being read (or for each
         entry in the volume requester). Parameters are as follows:

         A0 - (struct Hook *) your hook
         A2 - (struct rtFileRequester *) your filereq
         A1 - (struct FileInfoBlock *) fib of file OR (struct
             rtVolumeEntry *) device or assign in case of a volume
             requester.

         If your hook returns TRUE the file will be accepted. If it
         returns FALSE the file will be skipped and will not appear in
         the requester.

         IMPORTANT NOTE: If you change your hook's behavior you _MUST_
             purge the requester's buffer (using rtFreeReqBuffer())!

         IMPORTANT NOTE: When this callback hook is called from a volume
             requester the pr_WindowPtr of your process will be set to
             -1 so *no* DOS requesters will appear when an error occurs!

     RTFI_AllowEmpty - (BOOL) [V38] If RTFI_AllowEmpty is TRUE an empty
         file string will also be accepted and returned. Defaults to
         FALSE, meaning that if the user enters no filename the
         requester will be canceled. You should use this tag as little
         as possible!


Result
~~~~~~
::

     ret - TRUE if the user selected a file (check 'filereq->Dir' for
         the directory and 'filename' for the filename) or FALSE if the
         requester was canceled -- or a pointer to a struct rtFileList
         (if FREQF_MULTISELECT was used).


Notes
~~~~~
::

     You CANNOT call the file requester from a task because it uses DOS
     calls!

     Automatically adjusts the requester to the screen font.

     If the requester got too big for the screen because of a very large
     font, the topaz.font will be used.

     rtFileRequest() checks the pr_WindowPtr of your process to find the
     screen to put the requester on.

             rtFontRequestA() Useful in combination with
             FREQF_CHANGEPALETTE.

         FREQF_SCALE - allow fonts to be scaled when they don't exist in
             the requested size. (works on Kickstart 2.0 only, has no
             effect on 1.2/1.3).

         FREQF_STYLE - include gadgets so the user may select the font's
             style.

     RTFO_Height - (ULONG) Suggested height of font requester window.

     RTFO_OkText - (char *) Replacement text for "Ok" gadget. Maximum 6
         chars. (7 is still ok, but not esthetically pleasing)

     RTFO_SampleHeight - (ULONG) Height of font sample display in pixels
         (default 24).

     RTFO_MinHeight - (ULONG) Minimum font size displayed.

     RTFO_MaxHeight - (ULONG) Maximum font size displayed.

     RTFO_FilterFunc - (struct Hook *) [V38] Call this hook for each

         A2 - (struct rtFontRequester *) your filereq
         A1 - (struct TextAttr *) textattr of font

         If your hook returns TRUE the font will be accepted. If it

         the requester. IMPORTANT NOTE:  If you change your hook's
         behavior you _MUST_ purge the requester's buffer (using
         rtFreeReqBuffer())!


Result

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Puts up a requester to get a signed long (32-bit) number from the
     user.

     'reqinfo' can be used to customize the requester. For greater
     control use the tags listed below. The advantage of the rtReqInfo
     structure is that it is global, where tags have to be specified
     each function call. See libraries/reqtools.[hi] for a description
     of the rtReqInfo structure.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     &longvar - address of long (32 bit!) variable to hold result.
     title - pointer to null terminated title of requester window.
     reqinfo - pointer to a rtReqInfo structure allocated with
         rtAllocRequest() or NULL.
     taglist  - pointer to a TagItem array.

     RT_TextAttr - [V38] see rtEZRequestA(). Note that under 1.2/1.3 the
         string gadget's font will remain the screen font.

     RTGL_Min - (ULONG) Minimum allowed value. If the user tries to
         enter a smaller value the requester will refuse to accept it.

     RTGL_Max - (ULONG) Maximum allowed value, higher values are refused.

     RTGL_Width - (ULONG) Width of requester window in pixels. This is
         only a suggestion. rtGetLongA() will not go below a certain
         width.

     RTGL_ShowDefault - (BOOL) If this is TRUE (default) the value
         already in 'longvar' will be displayed in the requester when it
         comes up. If set to FALSE the requester will be empty.

     RTGL_GadFmt - (char *) [V38] Using this tag you can offer the user
         several responses. See rtEZRequestA() for more information.
         Note that selecting this gadget is considered a positive
         response so the integer in the gadget is copied to '&longvar'.

     RTGL_GadFmtArgs - (APTR) [V38] If you used formatting codes with
         RTGL_GadFmt use this tag to pass the arguments.

     RTGL_Invisible - (BOOL) [V38] Using this tag you can switch on
         invisible typing. Very useful if you need to get something like
         a code number from the user. It is strongly advised to use
         { RTGL_ShowDefault, FALSE } or the user may get very confused! 
         Default is FALSE.

     RTGL_BackFill - (BOOL) [V38] Backfill requester window with
         pattern. Default TRUE.

     RTGL_TextFmt - (char *) [V38] Print these lines of text above the
         gadget in the requester. Very useful to inform the user of what
         he should enter. Most of the time you will also want to set the
         GLREQF_CENTERTEXT flag. If you set the RTGL_BackFill tag to
         FALSE _no_ recessed border will be placed around the text.
         Formatting codes may be used in the string (see
         RTGL_TextFmtArgs tag).

     RTGL_TextFmtArgs - (APTR) [V38] If you used formatting codes with
         RTGL_TextFmt use this tag to pass the arguments.

     RTGL_Flags - (ULONG) [V38]

         GLREQF_CENTERTEXT - centers each line of text above the gadget
             in the requester window. Should be generally set.

         GLREQF_HIGHLIGHTTEXT - Highlight text above the gadget. You
             will normally only want to use this if you also turned off
             the window backfilling.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     ret - TRUE if user entered a number, FALSE if not. If one of your
         idcmp flags caused the requester to end 'ret' will hold this
         flag. If you used the RTGL_GadFmt tag the return code will hold
         the value of the response as with rtEZRequestA().


Notes
~~~~~

     'longvar' will NOT change if the requester is aborted.

     Automatically adjusts the requester to the screen font.

     rtGetLongA() checks the pr_WindowPtr of your process to find the
     screen to put the requester on.

     If you use the RTGL_GadFmt tag the return value is not always the
     gadget the user selected. If the integer gadget is empty and the
     user presses the leftmost gadget (normally 'Ok') rtGetLong() will
     return 0 (FALSE)! If the integer gadget is empty and the user
     presses one of the other gadgets rtGetLong() _will_ return its

rtGetStringA()
==============

Synopsis

 ULONG rtGetStringA(
          UBYTE * buffer,
          ULONG maxchars,

          char * title,
          struct rtReqInfo * reqinfo,
          TAG tag, ... );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Puts up a string requester to get a line of text from the user. The
     string present in 'buffer' upon entry will be displayed, ready to
     be edited.

     'reqinfo' can be used to customize the requester. For greater
     control use the tags listed below. The advantage of the rtReqInfo
     structure is that it is global, where tags have to be specified
     each function call. See libraries/reqtools.[hi] for a description
     of the rtReqInfo structure.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     buffer - pointer to buffer to hold characters entered.
     maxchars - maximum number of characters that fit in buffer
         (EX-cluding the 0 to terminate the string !).
     title - pointer to null terminated title of requester window.
     reqinfo - pointer to a rtReqInfo structure allocated with
         rtAllocRequest() or NULL.
     taglist - pointer to a TagItem array.

     RTGS_Width - (ULONG) Width of requester window in pixels. This is
         only a suggestion. rtGetStringA() will not go below a certain
         width.

     RTGS_AllowEmpty - (BOOL) If RTGS_AllowEmpty is TRUE an empty string
         will also be accepted and returned. Defaults to FALSE, meaning
         that if the user enters an empty string the requester will be
         canceled.

     RTGS_GadFmt - (char *) [V38] Using this tag you can offer the user
         severalresponses. See rtEZRequestA() for more information. Note
         that selecting this gadget is considered a positive response so
         the string in the gadget is copied to 'buffer'.

         invisible typing. Very useful if you need to get something like
         a password from the user. It is strongly advised to use an
         empty initial string or the user may get very confused! 
         Default is FALSE.

     RTGS_BackFill - (BOOL) [V38] Backfill requester window with
         pattern. Default TRUE.

     RTGS_TextFmt - (char *) [V38] Print these lines of text above the
         gadget in the requester. Very useful to inform the user of what
         he should enter. Most of the time you will also want to set the
         GSREQF_CENTERTEXT flag. If you set the RTGS_BackFill tag to
         FALSE _no_ recessed border will be placed around the text.
         Formatting codes may be used in the string (see
         RTGS_TextFmtArgs tag).

     RTGS_TextFmtArgs - (APTR) [V38] If you used formatting codes with
         RTGS_TextFmt use this tag to pass the arguments.

     RTGS_Flags - (ULONG) [V38]

         GSREQF_CENTERTEXT - centers each line of text above the gadget
             in the requester window. Should be generally set.

         GSREQF_HIGHLIGHTTEXT - Highlight text above the gadget. You
             will normally only want to use this if you also turned off
             the window backfilling.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     ret - TRUE if user entered something, FALSE if not. If one of your
         idcmp flags caused the requester to end 'ret' will hold this
         flag. If you used the RTGS_GadFmt tag the return code will hold
         the value of the response as with rtEZRequestA().


Notes

::

 ULONG rtGetVScreenSize(
          struct Screen * screen,
          ULONG * widthptr,
          ULONG * heightptr );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Use this function to get the size of the visible portion of a
     screen.

     The value returned by rtGetVScreenSize() can be used for vertical
     spacing. It will be larger for interlaced and productivity screens.
     Using this number for spacing will assure your requester will look
     good on an interlaced and a non-interlaced screen.

     Current return codes are 2 for non-interlaced and 4 for interlaced.
     These values may change in the future, don't depend on them too
     much. They will in any case remain of the same magnitude.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     screen - pointer to the screen.
     widthptr - address of an ULONG variable to hold the width.
     heightptr - address of an ULONG variable to hold the height.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     spacing - vertical spacing for the screen.

rtLockWindow()
==============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 APTR rtLockWindow(
          struct Window * window );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::


     Lock a window so it will no longer accept any user input.  The only
     functions left to the user are depth arrangement and window dragging.
     All gadgets will be un-selectable and the window can not be resized.
     It will also get the standard wait pointer set.  The pointer at the
     time of locking will be restored when the window is unlocked.

     You may nest calls to rtLockWindow() and rtUnlockWindow().  Just make
     sure you unlock the window in the correct (opposite) order.

     See the RT_LockWindow tag for an automatic way of locking your window.

     Use this function (and rtUnlockWindow()) instead of rtSetWaitPointer().
 

Inputs
~~~~~~
::


     window  --  pointer to the window to be locked


Result
~~~~~~
::


     a pointer to a (private) window lock.  You must pass this to
     rtUnlockWindow() to unlock the window again. Never mind if this is NULL.
     This means there was not enough memory and the window will not be locked.
     There is no sense in reporting this, just carry on and pass the NULL
     window lock to rtUnlockWindow().


Notes
~~~~~
::

     The wait pointer will look exactly like the standard Workbench 2.0
     wait pointer. In combination with PointerX, ClockTick or
     LacePointer the handle will turn.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Put up a palette requester so the user can change the screen's
     colors.

     The colors are changed in the viewport of the screen the requester
     will appear on, so that is where you will find them after the
     palette requester returns.

     The selected color is returned, so you can also use this requester
     to let the user select a color.

     'reqinfo' can be used to customize the requester. For greater
     control use the tags listed below. The advantage of the rtReqInfo
     structure is that it is global, where tags have to be specified
     each function call. See libraries/reqtools.[hi] for a description
     of the rtReqInfo structure.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     title - pointer to requester window title (null terminated).
     reqinfo - pointer to a rtReqInfo structure allocated with

         higher!

     RT_TextAttr - [V38] see rtFileRequestA() If the font is
         proportional on Kickstart 2.04 or below ReqTools will use the
         system default font or the font supplied with RT_DefaultFont.
         On Kickstart 3.0 or higher the proportional font is used.

     RTPA_Color - (ULONG) Initially selected color of palette. Default
         is 1.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     color - the color number of the selected color or -1 if the user
         canceled the requester.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Automatically adjusts the requester to the screen font. On
     Kickstart 2.04 or lower, if the screen font is proportional the
     default font will be used.

     If the requester got too big for the screen because of a very large
     font, the topaz.font will be used.

     rtPaletteRequestA() checks the pr_WindowPtr of your process to find
     the screen to put the requester on.

rtReqHandlerA()
===============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 IPTR rtReqHandlerA(
          struct rtHandlerInfo * handlerinfo,
          ULONG sigs,
          struct TagItem * taglist );
 
 IPTR rtReqHandler(
          struct rtHandlerInfo * handlerinfo,
          ULONG sigs,
          TAG tag, ... );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     This function should be called if you used the RT_ReqHandler tag
     with a requester function.

     The requester you used the tag with will have returned immediately
     after its initialization and will have initialized a pointer to a
     rtHandlerInfo structure for you. You should now do the following:

     Check the DoNotWait field. If it is FALSE you have to wait for the
     signals in the WaitMask field (plus your own signals if you like).
     If any of the signals in WaitMask are received or DoNotWait was not
     FALSE you have to call rtReqHandlerA() and check its return value
     for one of the following values:

     CALL_HANDLER - Check DoNotWait again, Wait() if you have to and
         call rtReqHandlerA() again. In other words, loop.
     everything else - normal return value, requester has finished. This
         return value will be the same as if the requester had run
         normally.

     You must pass the signals you received to rtReqHandlerA().

     NOTE: if you want to wait for your own signals do not do so if
         DoNotWait is TRUE. Call rtReqHandlerA() and if you must know if
         one of your signals arrived use SetSignal() to find this out.
         If you are waiting for a message to arrive at a message port
         you can simple call GetMsg() and check if it is non-null.
         DoNotWait will naturally only be TRUE when it absolutely,
         positively has to be. A multitasking machine as the Amiga
         should use Wait() as much as possible.

     This is an example of a "requester loop":

     ...
     struct rtHandlerInfo *hinfo;
     ULONG ret, mymask, sigs;

     ...
     // calculate our mask 
     mymask = 1 << win->UserPort->mp_SigBit;

     // We use the RT_ReqHandler tag to cause the requester to return
     // after initializing.
     // Check the return value to see if this setup went ok.
     if( rtFontRequest( req, "Font", RT_ReqHandler, &hinfo, TAG_END )
                                                    == CALL_HANDLER )
     {
         do
         {
             // Wait() if we can 
             if( !hinfo->DoNotWait )
             {
                 sigs = Wait( hinfo->WaitMask | mymask );
             }
             
             // check our own message port 
             while( msg = GetMsg( win->UserPort ) )
             {
                 ...
                 // here we handle messages received at our windows
                 // IDCMP port
                 ...
             }

             // let the requester do its thing (remember to pass 'sigs') 
             ret = rtReqHandler( hinfo, sigs, TAG_END );

             // continue this loop as long as the requester is up
         } while( ret == CALL_HANDLER )

         // when we get here we know the requester has finished, 'ret'
         // is the return code.
         ...
     }
     else
     {
         notify( "Error opening requester!" );
     }
     ...


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     handlerinfo - pointer to handler info structure initialized by
         using the RT_ReqHandler tag when calling a requester function.
     sigs - the signals received by previous wait, will be ignored if
         handlerinfo->DoNotWait was TRUE.
     taglist - pointer to a TagItem array.


Tags
~~~~
::

     RTRH_EndRequest - supplying this tag will end the requester. The
         return code from rtReqHandlerA() will _not_ be CALL_HANDLER,
         but the requester return code. If the tagdata of this tag is
         REQ_CANCEL the requester will be canceled, if it is REQ_OK the
         requester will be ok-ed. In case of an EZRequest tagdata should
         be the return code of the requester (TRUE, FALSE or 2,3,4,...).


Result
~~~~~~
::

     ret - CALL_HANDLER if you have to call rtReqHandlerA() again, or
         the normal return value from the requester.

rtScreenModeRequestA()
======================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 ULONG rtScreenModeRequestA(
          struct rtScreenModeRequester * screenmodereq,
          char * title,
          struct TagItem * taglist );
 
 ULONG rtScreenModeRequest(
          struct rtScreenModeRequester * screenmodereq,
          char * title,
          TAG tag, ... );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     *IMPORTANT* THIS REQUESTER IS ONLY AVAILABLE FROM KICKSTART 2.0
         ONWARDS! The 1.3 version of ReqTools also contains the
         screenmode requester, but unless you are running 2.0 or higher
         it will not come up. So what you essentially have to do is NOT
         call rtScreenModeRequestA() if your program is running on a
         machine with Kickstart 1.2/1.3. You can safely call
         rtScreenModeRequestA() if you are running on a 2.0 machine,
         even if the user has installed the 1.3 version of ReqTools.

     Get a screen mode from the user.

     The user will be able to pick a screen mode by name, enter the size
     and the number of colors (bitplane depth).

     rtScreenModeRequestA() will call the appropriate 2.0 functions to
     get all the mode's information. If no name has been assigned to the
     mode one will be constructed automatically.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     screenmodereq - pointer to a struct rtScreenModeRequester allocated
         with rtAllocRequestA().
     title - pointer to requester window title (null terminated).
     taglist - pointer to a TagItem array.

     RT_IntuiMsgFunc - (struct Hook *) [V38] The requester will call
         this hook for each IDCMP message it gets that doesn't belong to
         its window. Only applies if you used the RT_ShareIDCMP tag to
         share the IDCMP port with the parent window. Parameters are as
         follows:

         A0 - (struct Hook *) your hook
         A2 - (struct rtScreenModeRequester *) your req
         A1 - (struct IntuiMessage *) the message

         After you have finished examining the message and your hook
         returns, ReqTools will reply the message. So do not reply the
         message yourself!

     RT_Underscore - (char) [V38] Indicates the symbol that precedes the
         character in a gadget's label to be underscored. This will also
         define the keyboard shortcut for this gadget. Currently only
         needed for RTSC_OkText. Usually set to '_'.

     RT_DefaultFont - (struct TextFont *) This tag allows you to specify
         the font to be used in the requester when the screen font is
         proportional. Default is GfxBase->DefaultFont. This tag is
         obsolete in ReqTools 2.2 and higher.

     RT_TextAttr - [V38] see rtFileRequestA()

     RTSC_Flags - (ULONG) Several flags:

         SCREQF_OVERSCANGAD - Add an overscan cycle gadget to the
             requester. After the requester returns you may read the
             overscan type in 'rq->OverscanType' If this is 0 no
             overscan is selected (Regular Size), if non-zero it holds
             one of the OSCAN_... values defined in the include file
             'intuition/screens.[h|i]'.

         SCREQF_AUTOSCROLLGAD - Add an autoscroll checkbox gadget to the
             requester. After the requester returns read
             'smreq->AutoScroll' to see if the user prefers autoscroll
             to be on or off.

         SCREQF_SIZEGADS - Add width and height gadgets to the
             requester. If you do not add these gadgets the width and
             height returned will be the default width and height for
             the selected overscan type.

         SCREQF_DEPTHGAD - Add a depth slider gadget to the requester.
             If you do not add a depth gadget, the depth returned will
             be the maximum depth this mode can be opened in.

         SCREQF_NONSTDMODES - Include all modes. Unless this flag is set
             rtScreenModeRequestA() will exclude nonstandard modes.
             Nonstandard modes are presently HAM and EHB
             (ExtraHalfBrite). So unless you are picking a mode to do
             some rendering in leave this flag unset. Without this flag
             set the mode returned will be a normal bitplaned mode.

         SCREQF_GUIMODES - Set this flag if you are getting a screen
             mode to open a user interface screen in. The modes shown
             will be standard modes with a high enough resolution
             (minumum 640 pixels). If this flag is set the
             SCREQF_NONSTDMODES flag is ignored.

     RTSC_Height - (ULONG) Suggested height of screenmode requester
         window.

     RTSC_OkText - (char *) Replacement text for "Ok" gadget, max 6
         chars long.

     RTSC_MinWidth - (UWORD) The minimum display width allowed.

     RTSC_MaxWidth - (UWORD) The maximum display width allowed.

     RTSC_MinHeight - (UWORD) The minimum display height allowed.

     RTSC_MaxHeight - (UWORD) The maximum display height allowed.

     RTSC_MinDepth - (UWORD) The minimum display depth allowed. Modes
         with a minimum display depth lower than this value will not be
         included in the list.

     RTSC_MaxDepth - (UWORD) The maximum display depth allowed.

     RTSC_PropertyFlags - (ULONG) A mode must have these property flags
         to be included. Only bits set in RTSC_PropertyMask are
         considered.

     RTSC_PropertyMask - (ULONG) Mask to apply to RTSC_PropertyFlags to
         determine which bits to consider. See use of 'newsignals' and
         'signalmask' in exec.library/SetSignal(). Default is to
         consider all bits in RTSC_PropertyFlags as significant.

     RTSC_FilterFunc - (struct Hook *) Call this hook for each display
         mode id in the system's list. Parameters are as follows:

         A0 - (struct Hook *) your hook
         A2 - (struct rtScreenModeRequester *) your req
         A1 - (ULONG) 32-bit extended mode id

         If your hook returns TRUE the mode will be accepted. If it
         returns FALSE the mode will be skipped and will not appear in
         the requester.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     ret - FALSE if the requester was canceled or TRUE if the user
         selected a screen mode (check 'smreq->DisplayID' for the 32-bit
         extended display mode, 'smreq->DisplayWidth' and
         'smreq->DisplayHeight' for the display size,
         'smreq->DisplayDepth' for the screen's depth).


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Automatically adjusts the requester to the screen font.

     If the requester got too big for the screen because of a very large
     font, the topaz.font will be used.

     rtScreenModeRequest() checks the pr_WindowPtr of your process to
     find the screen to put the requester on.

rtScreenToFrontSafely()

Synopsis

 VOID rtScreenToFrontSafely(
          struct Screen * screen );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Brings the specified screen to the front of the display, but only after
     checking it is still in the list of currently open screens.

     This function can be used to bring a screen back to the front of the
     display after bringing another screen to the front.  If the first screen
     closed while you where busy it is harmless to call this function, unlike
     calling the normal ScreenToFront().

rtSetReqPosition()
==================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void rtSetReqPosition(
          ULONG reqpos,
          struct NewWindow * nw,
          struct Screen * scr,
          struct Window * win );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Sets newwindow->LeftEdge and newwindow->TopEdge according to reqpos.

     Except for the left- and topedge 'newwindow' must already be
     completely initialized.

     The newwindow->LeftEdge and newwindow->TopEdge already in the
     NewWindow structure will be used as offsets to the requested
     position. If you'd like a window at position (25,18) from the top
     left of the screen you would fill newwindow->LeftEdge with 25,
     newwindow->TopEdge with 18 and call rtSetReqPosition() with reqpos
     equal to REQPOS_TOPLEFTSCR.

     Don't forget to make sure newwindow->LeftEdge and newwindow->TopEdge
     are 0 if you don't want to offset your window.

     In case of REQPOS_POINTER you can use them to point to your window's
     hotspot, where the pointer should point. If you call
     rtSetReqPosition() with the left- and topedge equal to 0 you'd get
     a window appearing with its top- and leftedge equal to the current
     pointer position.

     Note that the screen pointer may _NOT_ be NULL. If you have your
     own window open you can supply yourwindow->WScreen to this function.

     The window pointer is only required if reqpos is REQPOS_CENTERWIN or
     REQPOS_TOPLEFTWIN. Even in this case you may call rtSetReqPosition()
     with a NULL window pointer. The positions will simply fall back to
     REQPOS_CENTERSCR and REQPOS_TOPLEFTSCR respectively.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     reqpos - one of the REQPOS_... constants usable with RT_ReqPos.
     newwindow - pointer to your (already initialized) NewWindow
         structure.
     screen - pointer to screen the requester will appear on.
     window - pointer to parent window or NULL.


Result

rtSetWaitPointer()
==================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 VOID rtSetWaitPointer(

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Change the pointer image to that of a wait pointer. This function should
     be called when your program is busy for a longer period of time.

     It is recommended you call this function before calling any of the
     requester functions.  This way if the user clicks in your window he will
     know he must respond to the requester before doing anything else.  Also
     see the RT_WaitPointer tag for an automatic way of setting the wait
     pointer.  If you are using ReqTools V38+ check out the RT_LockWindow tag!


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     window  --  pointer to the window to receive the wait pointer


Result
~~~~~~
::

     none


Notes
~~~~~
::

     The wait pointer will look exactly like the standard Workbench 2.0
     wait pointer. In combination with PointerX, ClockTick or
     LacePointer the handle will turn.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Evenly spread a number of objects over a certain length.
     Primary use is for arrangement of gadgets in a window.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     posarray - pointer to array to be filled with positions.
     sizearray - pointer to array of sizes.
     totalsize - total size of all objects (sum of all values in
         sizearray).
     min - first position to use.
     max - last position, first _NOT_ to use.
     num - number of objects (size of posarray and sizearray).


Result
~~~~~~
::

     none


Example
~~~~~~~

     'sizearray' holds following values: 4, 6, 4, 2 and 8,
     'totalsize' is 24 (= 4 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 8),
     'min' is 3, 'max' is 43,
     and finally, 'num' is 5.

     After calling rtSpread() 'posarray' would hold the following
     values: 3, 11, 19, 26 and 31.

     My attempt at a visual representation:
