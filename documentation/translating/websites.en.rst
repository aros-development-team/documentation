----

The AROS operating system and its websites are the public face of the project, offering users and developers access to:

- News and updates
- Downloadable builds
- User and developer documentation
- Community resources

Translating these sites helps make AROS accessible to users worldwide. While some documentation is technical and intended for developers, much of the material is for general users - and this is where translation is most important.

----

**Where to start:**

- Focus on **user guides** and **main website pages**. These are the most visible and impactful.
- Developer documentation is lower priority, except for **'Working with Git'** and **'Contribute'**, which help attract new contributors.

The documentation is extensive (over 100 pages), but you don't need to translate everything at once. Prioritize the core pages first.
