Translating the AROS operating system and its website helps reach a global audience and makes the OS easier to use for people who do not speak English.
By making AROS accessible in more languages, we hope to grow the user and developer community.

So far, only a few languages have been translated-often only partially-due to the limited number of translators and the size of the task.

We are always looking for **new translators** or **contributors** to help expand and improve these translations.
