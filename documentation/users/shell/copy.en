     Creates identical copies of one or more files.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::


     FROM      --  multiple input files
     TO        --  destination file or directory
     ALL       --  deep scan into sub directories
     QUIET     --  suppress all output and requesters
     BUFFER    --  buffer size for copy buffer in 512 byte blocks
                   (default 1024 (= 512K))
     CLONE     --  copy comment, protection bits and date as well
     DATES     --  copy dates
     NOPRO     --  do not copy protection bits
     COMMENT   --  copy file comment
     NOREQ     --  suppress requesters

     PATTERN   --  a pattern the filenames must match
     DIRECT    --  copy mode only: copy file without any tests or options
     VERBOSE   --  gives more output
     ERRWARN   --  do not proceed, when one file failed
     MAKEDIR   --  produce directories
     MOVE      --  delete source files after copying successful
     DELETE    --  do not copy, but delete the source files
     HARDLINK  --  make a hardlink to source instead of copying
     SOFTLINK  --  make a softlink to source instead of copying
     FOLNK     --  also makes links to directories
     FODEL     --  delete protected files also
     FOOVR     --  also overwrite protected files
     DONTOVR   --  never overwrite destination
     FORCE     --  DO NOT USE. Call compatibility only.
     NEWER     --  compare version strings and only overwrites older files.


 More detailed descriptions:

 FROM:
 Source file(s). For directories, all contained files are source files. May
 have standard patterns.

 TO:
 Destination file or for multiple sources destination directory. Destination
 directories are created (including all needed parent directories).

 ALL:
 Scan directories recursively

 QUIET:
 Copy is completely silent here. Really no output is given, also no requests
 for missing disks or other problems!

 BUF=BUFFER:
 Specify the number of 512 byte buffers for copying. Default are 200 buffers
 [100KB memory]. One buffer is minimum size, but should never be used.

 PAT=PATTERN:
 PATTERN allows to specify a standard dos pattern, all file have to match.
 This is useful with ALL option.

 Example:
 When you want to delete all .info files in a directory tree, you need
 this option: Copy DELETE #? ALL PAT #?.info

 CLONE:
 The filecomment, date and protection bits of the source files are copied to
 destination file or directory.

 DATES:
 The date information of source is copied to destination.

 NOPRO:
 The protection bits of sources are NOT copied. So the destination gets
 default bits [rwed].

 COM=COMMENT:
 The filecomment is copied to destination.

 NOREQ:
 No standard DOS requests are displayed, when an error occurs.


 DIRECT:
 Certain devices do not allow some of the used DOS packet request types.
 This option is a really easy copy command, which only opens source and
 destination directly without any tests and checks.
 Options ALL, PAT, CLONE, DATES, NOPRO, COM, MAKEDIR, MOVE, DELETE, HARD,
 SOFT, FOLNK, FODEL, FOOVR, DONTOVR and multiple input files cannot be
 specified together with DIRECT. This options needs one input and one output
 file.
 When you want to delete a softlink, which does no longer point to a valid
 file, you need this option as well.
 Example use: 'Copy DIRECT text PRT:' to print a file called text.
 - Copy manages a lot of such cases automatically, but maybe this option is
 needed sometimes.

 VERBOSE:
 Copy gives additional output.

 ERRWARN:
 Copy knows and returns the 3 types of dos.library errors:
 5   WARN    The processing of one file failed, Copy skips this file
             and proceeds the next.
 10  ERROR   The creation of a directory or any other bad error happend.
             Copy quits after that.
 20  FAIL    A really hard error happend (No memory, Examine failed, ...)
             Copy quits after that.
 When option ERRWARN is used, the result 5 (WARN) gets result 10 (ERROR). So
 Copy aborts everytime an error occured.

 MAKEDIR:
 All names specified in FROM field are taken as directories, which must be
 created.

 MOVE:
 The files are not copied, but moved (or renamed). This means that after
 move operation the source does no longer exist.

 DELETE:
 This does not copy anything, but deletes the source files!

 HARD=HARDLINK:
 Instead of copying the files, a hard link is created. This only works,
 when destination is on same device as source.
 When ALL option is specified, the directories are scanned recursively, else
 Copy produces links to the directories.

 SOFT=SOFTLINK:
 Instead of copying directories, a soft link is created. These links are
 useable between different devices also. Soft links are only created for
 directories. Files are skipped here. Option FORCELINK is therefor always
 set to true.
 NOTE: Softlinks are not official supported by OS and may be dangerous.
 I suggest not to use this option! See description below.

 FOLNK=FORCELINK:
 When linking of directories should be possible, this option is needed. See
 section "About links" for possible problems.

 FODEL=FORCEDELETE:
 When this option is enabled, files are deleted also, when they are delete
 protected.

 FOOVR=FORCEOVERWRITE:
 When this option is enabled, files are overwritten also, when they are
 protected.

 DONTOVR=DONTOVERWRITE:
 This option prevents overwriting of destination files.

 NEWER:
 This option scans the version strings of the source and destination files and
 only overwrites if the source file is newer than the destination file.
