Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     The ChangeTaskPri command is used to change the current run
     priority of a Task. As AROS is a multitasking operating
     system, you can determine which tasks receive more CPU time
     by changing their priorities.

     The value of |priority| can be from -128 to 127, however values
     greater than 4 are not recommended as they can interfere with
     vital system processes. Higher values will give tasks a higher
     CPU priority.

     You can use the Status command to examine the list of Tasks that
     are running and their process numbers.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     
     1.SYS:> ChangeTaskPri 1 Process 1

         Set the priority of the current process to 1.

     1.SYS:> ChangeTaskPri 1

         Also sets the priority of the current process to 1.
