Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::


     FILE/A,COMMENT,ALL/S,QUIET/S


Location
~~~~~~~~
::


     C:


Function
~~~~~~~~
::


     Add a comment to a file or directory.

     Filenote allows a recursive scan of all directories adding comments
     to each file/directory it finds that matches the file pattern
     specified.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::


     FILE    - Always has to be specified. Can be either a filename with
               a full path or a file pattern that is to be matched.

     COMMENT - The string that is to be added as a comment to the
               file(s)/dir(s) specified. If no comment is specified, any
               existing comment is deleted.

               To provide a comment that has embedded quotation marks,
               precede each quote with an asterisk.

                 i.e. Filenote FILE=RAM:test.txt COMMENT=*"hello*"

     ALL     - Boolean switch. If specified, Filenote scans the directories
               that match the pattern specified, recursively.

     QUIET   - Boolean switch. If specified, no diagnostic text will be
               displayed to stdout.


Result
~~~~~~
::


     Standard DOS return codes.


Example
~~~~~~~
::


     Filenote ram: hello all

         Recurses through each directory in RAM: adding "hello" as a
         filenote to each file/directory.


Notes
~~~~~
::


     Output from AROS' Filenote is more neat and structured than the
     standard Filenote command.

     Does not yet support multi-assigns.
