     AddBuffers (drive) [(N)]


Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::


     DRIVE/A, BUFFERS/N


Location
~~~~~~~~
::


     C:


Function
~~~~~~~~
::


     Add buffers to the list of available buffers for a specific
     drive. Adding buffers speeds disk access but has the drawback
     of using up system memory (typically 512 bytes per buffer).
     Specifying a negative number subtracts buffers from the drive.
         If only the DRIVE argument is specified, the number of
     buffers for that drive are displayed without changing the buffer
     allocation.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::


     DRIVE    --  the drive to alter the buffer allocation of
     BUFFERS  --  the number of buffers to add (or subtract in case of
                  a negative number) to a drive.
