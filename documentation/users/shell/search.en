::


 Search looks through the files contained in the FROM directory for
 a specified string (SEARCH); in case the ALL switch is specified,
 the subdirectories of the FROM directory are also searched. The name
 of all files containing the SEARCH string is displayed together with
 the numbers of the lines where the string occurred.
     If CTRL-C is pressed, the search will be abandoned. CTRL-D will
 abandon searching the current file.
