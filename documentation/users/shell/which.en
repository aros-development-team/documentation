Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::


     FILE/A, NORES/S, RES/S, ALL/S


Location
~~~~~~~~
::


     C:


Function
~~~~~~~~
::


     Find and print the location of a specific program.
     Resident programs are marked as RES if they are not
     internal resident in which case they are marked as INTERNAL.

     Which searches the resident list, the current directory,
     the command paths and the C: assign. If the item was not
     found the condition flag is set to WARN but no error is
     printed.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::


     FILE   --  the command to search for
     NORES  --  don't include resident programs in the search
     RES    --  consider resident programs only
     ALL    --  find all locations of the FILE. This may cause the
                printing of the same location several times, for
                instance if the current directory is C: and the
                FILE was found in C:


Notes
~~~~~
::


     For compatibility reasons these cases are handled specially:
     
     Absolute path:
         Prints the expanded path if it exists and is a file
         and no RES argument is given.
         
     Path which ends with a ':':
         Prints the expanded path if it exists and no RES argument is given.
