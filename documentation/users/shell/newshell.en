Synopsis

     C:


Function
~~~~~~~~
::


     Create a new shell in a new console window. This window will become
     the active one. The new shell inherits most attributes of the parent
     shell like the current directory, stack size, prompt and so on.
     However, it is completely independent of the parent shell.
     The window belonging to the new shell may be specified by
     using the WINDOW keyword.
