Function
~~~~~~~~
::


     This command does almost the same thing as C:LoadMonDrvs does on
     other systems. However, additionally we support priority-based
     sorting for display drivers. This is needed in order to make monitor
     ID assignment more predictable.

~~~~~~
::


     NOCOMPOSITION   -- Only load Monitors
     ONLYCOMPOSITION -- Only load Compositor
