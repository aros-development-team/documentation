Function
~~~~~~~~
::


     Carry out all the commands in a block if a given conditional is true.
     (A block is a run of command lines ended with an Else or EndIf
     command.) For every If command there must be a corresponding EndIf.
     If the condition is false, command execution will skip to the
     corresponding Else of EndIf command.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::


     NOT               --  Negates the value of the condition

     WARN              --  True if the previous return code was greater
                           than or equal to 5.
     ERROR             --  True if the previous return code was greater
                           than or equal to 10.
     FAIL              --  True if the previous return code was greater
                           than or equal to 20.

     EQ, GE, GT        --  True if the first value is equal, greater than
                           or equal respectively greater than the second.

     VAL               --  Indicate that the comparison should treat the
                           strings as numerical values.

     EXISTS  <string>  --  True if the file or directory <string> exists.



Example
~~~~~~~
::


     If 500 GT 200 VAL
         echo "500 is greater than 200"
     Else
         If EXISTS S:User-Startup
             echo "User-Startup script found in S:"
             Execute S:User-Startup
         EndIf
     EndIf


Notes
~~~~~
::


     ERROR and FAIL will only be appropriate if the fail level of the
     script is set via FailAt (the standard fail level is 10 and if any
     return code exceeds or equals this value, the script will be aborted).
