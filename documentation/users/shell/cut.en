Location

     SYS:C


Function
~~~~~~~~
::


     Extracts some characters or words from a string.


Result
~~~~~~
::


     Standard DOS return codes.


Notes
~~~~~
::


     Both  CHAR  (character)  and WORD arguments allow to define a begin and an end
     position  in the original string. Words are strings separated by a SEPARATOR (a
     space character (" ") is the default), which can also be a string.

     Positions  range  is specified using numbers with the form "P1-P2", where "P1"
     is  the position of the first character (resp. word) to extract in the original
     string, "-" is the hyphen-minus character, and "P2" is the position of the last
     character (resp. word) to extract.

     If  only  one  position  is  supplied, then only one character (resp. word) is
     extracted,  unless  the  hyphen-minus  character is supplied too: P- extracts a
     string  begining  at  the  character (resp. word) at position P in the original
     string until the end, and -P extracts a string starting at the beginning of the
     original  string,  and  ending with the character (resp. word) at position P in
     the original string.

 EXAMPLES

     Example 1:
     > Cut "A dummy sentence" CHAR 7
     y
     extract one character.

     Example 2:
     > Cut "A dummy sentence" CHAR 6-12
     my sent
     extract from character 6 to 12.

     Example 3:
     > Cut "A dummy sentence" CHAR -7
     A dummy
     extract from character 1 to 7 without specifying the beginning position.

     Example 4:
     > Cut "A dummy sentence" CHAR 12-
     tence
     extract from character 12 of the string until the end.

     Example 5:
     > Cut "A dummy sentence" WORD 2 SEPARATOR "en"
     t
     extract the second word (using an user-defined separator).
