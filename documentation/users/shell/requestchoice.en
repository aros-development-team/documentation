     RequestChoice


Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::


     TITLE/A,BODY/A,GADGETS/A/M,PUBSCREEN/K


Location
~~~~~~~~
::


     C:


Function
~~~~~~~~
::


     Allows AmigaDOS scripts to have access to the EasyRequest() function
     for input.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::


     TITLE       - The text to display in the title bar of the requester.

     BODY        - The text to display in the body of the requester.

     GADGETS     - The text for each of the buttons.

     PUBSCREEN   - The name of the public screen to open the requester
                   upon.


Result
~~~~~~
::


     Standard DOS return codes.


Example
~~~~~~~
::


     RequestChoice "This is a title" "This is*Na body" Okay|Cancel

         This is self-explanitory, except for the "*N". This is the
         equivalent of using a '\n' in C to get a newline in the body
         of the requester. This requester will open on the Workbench
         screen.

     RequestChoice Title="This is a title" Body="This is*Na body"
                   Gadgets=Okay|Cancel PubScreen=DOPUS.1

         This will do exactly the same as before except that it will
         open on the Directory Opus public screen.


Notes
~~~~~
::


     To place a newline into the body of the requester use *n or *N.

     To place a quotation mark in the body of the requester use *".

     The CLI template gives the GADGETS option as ALWAYS given; this
     is different from the original program. This way, we do not have
     to check to see if the gadgets have been given.
