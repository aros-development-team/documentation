Latest updates
--------------

Many things happened during the last summer and AROS developers
are constantly improving the operating system:

Paolo Besser has released the new 0.9.1 beta version of his VmwAROS
distribution, which introduces improvements in the GUI style and
all the following enhancements to system files. New software has 
been added or updated as well. 
Once again, the distribution is available in two flavours: a
`live CD`__ which runs on top of any X86 hardware and can be
installed on the hard drive, and a `virtual environment`__ for
VMware.

Pavel Fedin is working on a Windows-hosted version of AROS. You
can read something about his progresses here *(dead link removed)*. Michal Schulz
has completed porting AROS to the SAM 440EP board and now he's
porting AROS to the Efika PPC platform.

Jo√£o Ralha is helping us translating catalogs to Portuguese.

Krzysztof Smiechowicz has enabled GRUB2 in the nightly builds,
changing the bootloader AROS used from the beginning. GRUB2 allows
more options and is much more compatible with modern hardware than
its old version, so this change should also reduce glitches AROS
had on some configurations at boot time.

Nick Andrews has released Sis 900 and e1000 network drivers for
AROS. People with these network cards can now connect to the
Internet and communicate with local area networks.

Nick Andrews has also enabled a snapshot function in Wanderer, 
allowing people to fix windows size and behavior.

Markus Weiss has ported GCC/G++ 4.2.2 to i386 AROS Native. This
should help other people developing and porting their software to
AROS.

Stanislaw Szymczyk has made huge progress towards AROS self 
compilation. There are still some glitches to fix, but the day
AROS can build itself is near. You can read something about his
work at Cogville *(dead link removed)*.

Krzysztof Smiechowicz has completed reviewing AROS API
completeness, and now he's working on libraries and other system
components. Results are available in our `status`__ page.

Randy Vice has quit collecting bounties for AROS: TeamAROS has
been closed but all the opened bounties are now managed by a new
non-profit organization, `Power-2-People`__. We would like to thank
Randy for all the support and time he dedicated to AROS in the past,
and give P2P a great welcome. Please keep on supporting AROS through
the `new bounty system`__.
