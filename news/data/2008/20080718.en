Latest updates
--------------

Sorry for this status update being so late, however the AROS team is
really working hard "under the hood" in order to bring you a better
operating system. There is much important news to talk about.

Stanislaw Szymczyk has completed the port of linux hosted flavour
on the x86-64 platform, and is greatly helping AROS self-compilation
by porting the needed tools. The last one has been the abc-shell, and
he's gaining some encouraging results.

Krzysztof Smiechowicz is reviewing AROS API completeness, in order to
keep track of AmigaOS compatibility and the whole project's status. You
can see the results whenever you want in our updated `status`__ page.

Pavel Fedin has greatly improved HDToolBox functionalities: now it
can move and resize partitions. These new features, however, still
need some testing. Pavel has also ported BHFormat and activated
Wanderer options to format disks.

Pavel Fedin, Krzysztof Smiechowicz and Tomasz Wiszkowski are also
working hard on our ata.device and ATAPI-related files to get rid of
compatibility problems which disallowed AROS to boot properly on some
configurations. 

Michal Schulz is still working on his SAM440EP porting of AROS. He
recently released a working `initial beta`__ that SAM owners may try
by themselves. Don't place it on other PPC architectures, though, as
it won't work.

Gianfranco Gignina has helped detecting and fixing many Zune bugs,
and started to work on a portable and more independent version of
Wanderer. The project's goal is to allow easy porting of Wanderer to
the other AmigaOS-like platforms.

There's a new, valuable implementation of the E language on AROS:
it's `PortablE`__, and you should definitely give it a try!

Nick Andrews is writing an Intel Gigabit E1000 NIC driver for AROS, which
will allow networking on a wide range of motherboards that integrate it.

Paolo Besser has released the new 0.8b version of his VmwAROS
distribution, which introduces improvements in the GUI style and
a new dual-kernel feature to allow booting on some configurations.
Once again, the distribution is available in two flavours: a
`live CD`__ which runs on top of any X86 hardware and can be
installed on the hard drive, and a `virtual environment`__ for
VMware.
