Distributions
-------------

Two AROS distributions have been recently released. VmwAROS LIVE! and
a new WinAROS version. The former is a bootable and installable
pre-configured environment based on the VmwAROS virtual machine, the
latter is a QEMU-tailored virtual machine complete with IDE and 
updated development environment. More details are available in our
`download page`__. Users and application developers are encouraged to
download them.

Latest news
-----------

Krysztof Smiechowicz and Alain Greppin have provided
a public binary native i386 package of gcc/g++ 3.3.1 - based on Fabio's
patches, downloadable from the Archives. This is obviously a good
news for anyone interested in developing or porting software to AROS,
but it is not the only one: on the Archives you can find also the new
C++ supporting version of Murks!IDE, AROS' best Integrated Development
Environment, brought to us by Krysztof Smiechowicz and Heinz-Raphael
Reinke.

It's also time for serious bugfixing. Krysztof Smiechowicz has started
reviewing API completeness, while Barry Nelson reviewed, filtered and
started managing our bug tracker. Lots of already-fixed bugs have been
removed from the list.

Nic Andrews and Alain Greppin have finally implemented grub2 in AROS.
Nic showed a nice `screenshot`__ on Aros-Exec too. The great news about
this, is users can finally get rid of slow FFS partitions and boot
system files from SFS ones. This option isn't encouraged yet, however,
due to some still existing compatibility flaws with some AROS 
applications.

Alain Greppin has completed AROS DHCP bounty with his dhclient command.
AROS can now get automatic IP address configuration. He also ported 
TeXlive *(dead link removed)*.

Tomasz Wiszkowski and Michal Schulz are working on the ata.device in
order to improve it. Initial support has been added for some Serial ATA
chipsets: "SATA controllers supporting legacy operation mode should now
be operational (this means we don't have AHCI at this moment)".
