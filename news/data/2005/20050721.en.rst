While AROS developers are constantly fixing bugs and adding features (well... not so many noticeable features
from the user point of view, but interesting for coders), we have noticed that our community is constantly growing!
New apps are coming and we're very excited to delight your eyes with this pic *(dead link removed)*. Yes,
Darius Brewka *(dead link removed)* is porting nice AmiStart to AROS, providing a faster way to access applications
(in a really sexy way too!).

Recently, two AROS-related blogs are born. Paul J. Beel has set up on the web The AROS Show *(dead link removed)*, which focuses
on software releases and documentation: "I plan to make this a place where you can read information about the
AROS Research Operating System (...). The AROS Show will try to answer some of the questions you may have about
AROS, while providing you with information about the community, happenings and developers. It will do it's best
to update you on current and upcoming applications in AROS". Good Luck Paul!

If you are interested in AROS development and in fresh news, you can also visit our talented developer Kalamatee's
`blog`__. There is also a new interesting link to follow: if you want to know what software has already been ported
and what may need your hand for porting, you can give a sight to `The definitive AROS platform capability list`__,
which probably contains most of the informations you need.

And please continue visiting `AROSWorld`__, with its 400+ users base and its new fresh look!
