AROS has got its first software repository on the web, `The AROS Archives`__. Its mission is providing a central place where AROS developers can upload their software, and users can find AROS "fresh meat". We strongly encourage coders to upload their creations and portings. 

For everybody stuck with AROS installation, there are two new intersting HOW-TOs. Mark Carter wrote guides to `install AROS on hard disk`__ and to `install AROS on a linux-hosted system`__. Simply click on the links to read!
