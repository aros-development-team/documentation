Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way... ehm! It's Christmas
again (enjoy!), and there is some happy news for AROS, too. We're
constantly developing new code and fixing the existing code, and there
are some new brilliant features to show here. 

First of all, AROS has finally got a new, faster and smarter file
system: Michal Schulz has ported SFS to the AROS Research Operating
System, so opening and saving lots of files won't take ages anymore,
but just a few seconds. In order to use SFS on your hard disks,
however, you still have to follow a tricky procedure. We're going to
fix this. Here *(dead link removed)* you can see some benchmarks, and look at a defrag
application `screenshot`__ too.

Neil Cafferkey has written an Intel Pro/100 NIC driver, allowing
support for the i8255x family of network adapters. If you're wondering
what to do once you enter the net, you may chat with Nick Andrew's
`AiRcOS`__, the first IRC client for our operating system. It's still
in alpha stage, but it works *(dead link removed)*!

Marcel 'Frostwork' Unbehaun has created an `AROS/PPC Live-CD for
Pegasos`__ computers. The file is provided as a torrent by Pegasos.org,
so a Torrent client is needed for downloading. Last but not least,
there is a new Aros-Max distribution for x86 on the works. In the
meanwhile, you may download this nice `v0.4.8`__ and report problems
here *(dead link removed)*.

Well, that's over. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to everyone from
us all.
