Summer is a great time for coding, but also spring has brought to us lots of new
stuff. We are so busy porting software and adding new features to the OS, that
we always forget to update this site. Well, we hope it won't never happen again
in the future..

There are so many things to talk about, that's even difficult to begin. First of
all, we have to announce that future versions of `Hollywood`__ will be available
also for AROS. Hollywood is a Multimedia Application Layer for Amiga(tm) and
compatible operating systems. It offers you a script language and advanced
functions that allow the creation of multimedia applications, ranging from a
simple slideshow to a complex game.

Airsoft Softwair is not the only commercial believer in AROS: `AHT Europe`__ has
announced support for AROS in their upcoming PPC Ariana set-top boxes. According
to their press release, "AHT Europe Ltd. want to provide their customers an
additional slim operating system with an intuitive user-interface design for
simple home-computer functionality".

AROS-Max
--------

A new improved version of `AROS-Max`__ is on the way! This is a nicely configured
bootable CD image with a lot more snacks than the regular snapshots and builds.
Stay tuned...

Improved sound support
----------------------

Martin Blom has released a new version of AHI. You can find it at his `homepage`__.

Networking
----------

Nic Andrews, Jack Patton, Olivier Adam and Adam Chodorowski are still working 
on integrating lwIP__ into AROS with some assistance from Staf Verhaegen.

But the big news is that Neil Cafferkey has ported AmiTCP. This finally gives
AROS a TCP/IP stack and the power of networking! There is already a simple FTP
client available, and a porting of nice old `Mosaic`__ is on the road. Well,
maybe it's not Mozilla, but at least we can setup an http page with Cheetah__ 
and browse html pages (offline) with a real browser!
