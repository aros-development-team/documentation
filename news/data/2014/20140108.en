2013 was mainly a year of internal improvements and fixes to AROS, so 
there were fewer new bells and whistles added to it than in previous 
years. However, there were still a few notable components introduced 
that should be mentioned.

New C libraries
---------------

After a long journey a cleaned up and split C library was commited to the
ABIv1 branch. Next to a clean up and some improved documentation, the main
part of the patch is a split of the ANSI standard part from the POSIX
part. This allows using standard C functions everywhere in AROS without
having a POSIX emulation overhead added.

Raspberry Pi
------------

In 2012 we reported that AROS was running on the Raspberry Pi, but 
hosted on top of Linux. In 2013 a native version of AROS for this 
compact and ubiquitous platform emerged, with support for USB, SD card 
and graphics (at least with the aid of the proprietary binary blob that 
Linux also relies upon).

Scalos ported
-------------

The Wanderer/Workbench replacement `Scalos`__ has been ported to AROS.
Currently it is only available in nightly builds of `ABIv1`__ of the
i386 platform. Scalos can either be started like an application from
*Extras:Scalos* or it can replace Wanderer by exchanging
``Wanderer:Wanderer`` by ``Scalos:Scalos EMU`` in ``S:Startup-Sequence``.

Sound drivers
-------------

Three new drivers were added for VIA audio controllers, namely some of 
their Envy24, Envy24HT and AC97 chipsets. Compatibility of our HD Audio 
driver was also increased, and it now supports a wider range of 
controllers and codecs.

Miscellaneous
-------------

Lots of smaller improvements were also made, including bug fixes and 
refactoring to components such as ATA and SATA drivers, filesystems and 
partitioning, EFI support, and system shutdown. User interfaces received 
some attention too, with the Zune GUI system gradually becoming more 
complete, and new preferences utilities for GRUB and theming options.
