A Year in Review
================

Once again, the news has been long delayed, mainly because we've been 
too busy adding features and fixes to AROS. In fact, so much has 
happened in the last year that what follows is only a selection of 
highlights.

AROS 68k and other new platforms
--------------------------------

An important new chapter has been opened in AROS's history with the 
development of a stand-alone AROS port for the original Amiga computers. 
This should also be of great interest to people using WinUAE to run old 
Amiga applications. Such is the level of compatibility, the AROS ROM 
image can even boot original Workbench disks as old as V1.3. This 
development will hopefully also lead to improved integration of original 
Amiga software into AROS on x86 platforms and elsewhere.

AROS's platform support has continued to diversify in other directions 
too. A Linux-hosted ARM port has emerged, and new hosted ports for Mac 
OS X support three different CPU architectures. And AROS may soon become 
even more portable with the recent development of new iOS and Android 
ports.

Graphics
--------

On the PC-compatible/x86 front, a lot has been happening too, 
particularly in the area of graphics. The Intel GMA graphics driver has 
been extended to support a wider variety of chipsets, and also now works 
with laptop LCD displays as well as external monitors. The Nouveau and 
Gallium based driver for nVidia graphics cards has been improved too: as 
well as increasing its speed and hardware support, it has also become 
the first driver with hardware-accelerated alpha-blending operations.

A notable graphics feature from our Amiga heritage has also been 
introduced to AROS: most native graphics drivers now support screen 
dragging and scrolling. These include our drivers for nVidia and Intel 
GMA chipsets, as well as the generic VESA driver.

Apart from the graphics drivers, AROS also received some additional 
graphics libraries: egl.library and openvg.library. The first provides 
portable GL initialization and window management interfaces, while the 
second is a vector graphics library accelerated using Gallium. Our port 
of the SDL library has become more polished too, with improvements to 
features such as SDL-to-GL integration, leading to a more enjoyable 
gaming experience.

Wireless networking
-------------------

Two significant milestones in network support for laptops have been 
reached. Firstly, a modern and secure wireless networking stack has been 
added to AROS. The first driver to use this infrastructure supports many 
popular cards with Atheros chipsets. Secondly, support has been added 
for a wide variety of mobile broadband USB devices.

Other improvements
------------------

Debugging support and error reporting have been improved. Misuse and 
mismanagement of memory and other resources by applications is now more 
easily detected, and error reports now include stack traces showing 
where the error occurred.

A lot of fine tuning and ease-of-use improvements have been made to 
various components. The FAT filesystem handler has received a number of 
important bug fixes. Native graphics drivers are now typically activated 
automatically for detected graphics cards, and the AC97 and HDAudio 
sound drivers usually need no manual configuration before use. And at 
last, AROS is no longer stuck with one unchangeable mouse pointer: the 
standard pointer to use can be chosen in a new pointer preferences 
program, and applications can change the pointer to suit different 
situations. The AROS shell has become more sophisticated, and now has a 
scrollable output history, as well as support for more modes and some 
bug fixes. AROS's handling of GUI themes has also become significantly 
faster. Finally, another piece of the backwards-compatibility jigsaw has 
been filled following the transformation of Regina into a much more 
complete ARexx clone.

Wider developments
------------------

AROS now has a third distribution available in addition to the regularly 
updated `Icaros Desktop`__ and AROS Broadway *(dead link removed)*. The new `AspireOS`__
distribution is aimed mainly at the Acer 
Aspire One 110 and 150 netbooks, but may also be interesting to users of 
other PCs looking for a lightweight distribution.

Many applications and games have been added to AROS's software selection 
in recent months. Some application highlights include AmiFig, Protrekkr 
and Open Universe. 3D games such as Cube, AssaultCube and Super Tux Kart 
(with a popular kitty car!) put AROS's 3D graphics enhancements to good 
use, while many 2D games such as Giana's Return and Mega Mario have also 
arrived. We have added a number of emulators too to allow even more 
retro gaming fun to be had.
