In July the AROS core received a number of small fixes and updates from
various contributors, including Neil Cafferkey, Krzysztof Smiechowicz,
Matthias Rustler and Stefan Haubenthal. Notably, this work included fixing
the native GCC to correctly search for SDK paths.

Outside of core AROS developments, an interesting offer has been made by
the `Apollo Team`__ . They offered free Vampire accelerator cards to
developers interested in improving AROS 68k. More information can be found
in this thread *(dead link removed)*.

We've also seen a good portion of new applications being released for
AROS. A number of games have been ported and are now available for
download from the `Archives`__ . Next, the SimpleMail mail client, has been
updated to version 0.41. Finally, a retro gaming center program called
EMULA has been made public by its author, Fabio Falcucci. EMULA is free to
use and includes additional features based on a subscription model.

Closing July's highlights, Pascal Papara released a new preview build of
his AROS x86 distribution called AROS Broadway. More information can be
found here *(dead link removed)*.
