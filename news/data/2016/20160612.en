May 2016 Highlights

As the days finally got warmer in the Northern hemisphere, the activity of
both users and developers of AROS reached quite low levels in May.

Krzysztof Smiechowicz made the necessary fixes to the source code to
re-enable the x86_64 build of AROS, which was not available for
over three months. Right now nightly build targets for all supported
architectures are available.

In May the first version of a new, interesting application has been made
available by Marcus Sacrow. Mapparium is an OpenStreetMap client
working under AROS and MorphOS. Current functionality allows, for
example, browsing the map and searching for locations.

Closing, a new survey has been launched in order to understand how
AROS is used by people and how it can become even more useful. If
you have not done so, please answer the survey questions in this
thread *(dead link removed)*.
