This month the developments were dominated by Nick Andrews who
was working on animation.datatype and specialized animation
classes. These components were missing for a long time in AROS
and we are happy to see Nick take up this work. The work is
additionally financed by a bounty hosted by Power2People.org. Nick
already delivered the gif and mpeg classes as well as making substantial
improvements to the anim class. MultiView was also extended along
the way.

Following on the topic of bounties, two new bounties were opened. The first
targets a new port of the Python programming language. The complete
work is split into five stages: for now the first stage bounty is
defined, which aims at porting the core of Python 2.7. The second new
bounty will deliver overscan support to AROS 68k Amiga chipset
video drivers. More details can be found on `Power2People`__.

Further progress has been made on supporting the 68k platform, with
Scalos, a Workbench replacement, now functioning correctly
under AROS 68k. In more 68k news, Olaf Schoenweiss released a
new milestone build of his AROS 68k distribution called
"AROS Vision". The version is now 3.0 and brings a lot of important
improvements.

Following up on third party developments, Frederik Wikstrom, who
in November completed the FUSE bounty, delivered an updated
version of the filesysbox.library and NTFS and exFAT drivers.

Closing the January highlights, AROS made it to AmigaFuture,
the printed Amiga magazine. The January/February issue
contains an interview with Krzysztof Smiechowicz, one of the core
AROS developers.
