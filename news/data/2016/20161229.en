November saw a fair amount of changes in AROS system. Neil Cafferkey
provided further improvements to MUI and made 3D acceleration on
the IntelGMA video driver work again. Krzysztof Smiechowicz fixed
Windows-hosted AROS port, enabling Windows users to enjoy AROS again,
and was making final changes to ABIv0 system refresh. Olivier Brunner
fixed a memory trashing problem in AROS MUI List class and Miloslav Martinka
made a small but useful improvement to Wanderer's Info tool, which from now
on shows the path at which the icon is located and allows opening that
path in separate Wanderer window.

Paolo Besser, who is working on next version of Icaros, `announced`__ that
it will support also hosted flavors of AROS which is a welcomed
development by AROS community. It means Linux and Windows users will be
able to enjoy Icaros without a need to install virtual machine.

Third party development also provided new, interesting software. Marcus
Sacrow prepared versions of his EdiSyn and Maporium applications for AROS
ARM platform, which is a very welcomed development as ARM platform has very
few 3rd party applications at the moment. Yannick Erb provided a new
version of MAME (Multiple Arcade Machines Emulator) which can be downloaded
from AROS Archives.
