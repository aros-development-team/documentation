This month's highlights start with the results of the AROS 2016 usage 
survey. The survey was aimed at understanding the ways in which AROS is used 
and what is needed to make it more useful. In total 50 people took part and 
you can read the results of the survey in this thread *(dead link removed)*. Thank you to all 
who participated!

June also saw the release of an update to Icaros Desktop, the leading x86 
distribution by Paolo Besser. The update, presented as version 2.1.2, brings 
a refreshed 68K environment, new cloud service drivers and a few updated 
applications. Visit `www.icarosdesktop.org/`__ to download the update.

As a final highlight, Krzysztof Smiechowicz began work to refresh the 
ABI_V0-compatible system files with the latest developments from the AROS 
trunk. The last refresh was done at the end of 2014, so it is a good time to 
bring the new functionalities to the AROS community. The refreshed version 
is expected to be available in Fall 2016.
