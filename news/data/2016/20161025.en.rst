September was definitely a distro month. First, the AEROS distribution
was refreshed by Pascal Papara and brought to version 4.2.1 on all
supported platforms (Raspberry Pi 1/2/3 and Odroid XU3/XU4). The
changes include integration of EmuLa, installation of the Chrome browser
supporting Flash, SDL2 libraries, ScummVM 1.8 and the game 'Amiga Racer'.

Staying on the ARM platform, September also saw the first release of an
AROS distribution targeted at the Orange Pi platform. The distribution,
called PiAROS, uses the hosted version of AROS, similar to AEROS.

Lastly, Icaros Desktop, the x86 distribution by Paolo Besser, received
an update and is now available in version 2.1.3. The new version brings
updates to several applications, including Odyssey Web Browser, PortablE,
SimpleMail and Mapparium.

In core AROS development we had two activities. While Neil Cafferkey
continued making improvements to MUI, Miloslav Martinka added Czech
localization to a number of applications as well as implementing
localization in Appearance preferences.
