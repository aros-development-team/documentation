Habemus DOSpackets!
-------------------

Robert Norris has made the initial commit 
of the AROS packet system in our repository, with a read 
only FAT filesystem handler too. Here's what he said:

"packet.handler is a "proxy" AROS-style filesystem that is primarily 
responsible for taking FSA/IOFileSys, converting them to DosPackets and 
sending them on to the packet-based handler.

The important thing to note about packet.handler is that its been 
designed to mimic the AmigaOS handler environment as closely as 
possible, to minimise the amount of work necessary to port a  filesystem.

fat.handler is a FAT12/16/32 handler. Read-only, and still 
has a few bugs, but it proves the concept. There's still plenty of work to be 
done before I consider the bounty finished. Comments are very welcome."

DOSPackets and FAT read-only support should be available in the next 
nightly builds.
