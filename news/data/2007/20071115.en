AROS has gained lots of bugfixes and improvements in the lastest 
weeks. For istance, Neil Cafferkey has corrected some important bugs
in his beloved AROS Installer *(dead link removed)*; Nic Andrews has worked on his 
RTL8139 network driver; and Robert Norris has fixed file 
notifications, which previously broke preferences, just to name 
three. 

Robert Norris has added a SDL driver for linux hosted AROS. This 
lets you build a hosted AROS that doesn't require X (you don't even need it installed to build anymore). In theory this could help with getting hosted running on other platforms (anywhere SDL exists), however it's a little slower than the X driver.

Matthias Rustler has ported ptplay.library to AROS. It renders 
Protracker modules into sound samples. Additionally he also ported 
ShellPlayer, a simple example player. They will be in nightly
builds, in Extras/MultiMedia/Audio drawer.

Matthias Rustler also made an initial port of Alain Thellier's 
`Wazp3D`__ to AROS. Wazp3D is a library intended to be compatible 
with the famous Warp3D.library for AmigaOS 68040, and it makes easier 
to port some 3D Amiga games to AROS. Wazp3D can also work as a 
software renderer, fooling applications looking for a 3D hardware 
driver.

Michal Schulz has made some big steps further with his 
`x86-64`__ port of AROS. The day of 64 bit AROS computing is 
getting near. In the meanwhile, Michal added also SSE instructions 
support to AROS.

Petr Novak has translated `aros.org in Czech`__.
