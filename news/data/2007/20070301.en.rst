Starting from today, AROS snapshots won't be available 
anymore. We'd encourage everyone who would try AROS to download the 
latest nightly build instead. AROS is growing really fast, and 
Snapshots often contained obsolete code. We also think nightly 
builds are more useful from a beta-testing point of view, as they 
contain the latest features: please use the `bug tracker`__ to report 
bugs.

Due to an update of Sourceforge's servers, latest nightly builds 
were not available. Now that this work is over, everything should be 
back to normality.
