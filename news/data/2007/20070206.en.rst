A new year of AROS development has begun, and probably it wouldn't 
start in a better way. There are two big news for all AROS users.

First of all, drag & drop is now working! This means you may 
use Wanderer both to copy a file from a drawer to another, and 
to open a file by dropping its icon on applications. This 
"miracle" has been made by Christoph Szczecina and Darius 
Brewka. There is a `small VMware video`__ that shows AROS with drag & drop!

Some stability problems on AROS native are under 
investigation and should be resolved in the next days. 

Robert Norris has completed network support for linux hosted AROS. 
Tap interface is working and you may find it in latest nightly builds.

William Ouwehand has created a `dutch version of Aros.org`__.
AROS compilation guide *(dead link removed)* by Christoph Szczecina for Ubuntu Linux 
also have been added.

Nic Andrews has made inital commits for RTL 8139 and VIA Rhine 
network adapters drivers. They're still a work in progress, but 
probably it won't took too much time to be completed. TeamAROS website
has a bounty for VIA Rhine driver.
