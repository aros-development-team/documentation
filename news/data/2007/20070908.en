Michal Schulz is working on x86-64 version's low-level parts of 
exec.library - the scheduler and interrupt handlers. The bootstrap 
code has changed a lot and he has managed to compile several 
libraries (thanks to the gigantic effort of Henning Kiel, who fixed 
sources for 64-bit compatibility) into separate modules. In other 
words, the 64-bit kernel is about to boot, multitask and start 
the autoinit route of exec.library soon.

If you have installed an ageing nightly build of AROS, please go to 
the download section and grab a new one. There had been lots of 
important bugfixes, and also some nice cosmetic enhancements. 
After our competition, we have got two "official" wallpapers 
installed by default: `"AROS rose" by d980`__ for the desktop, and 
`"AROS"`__ by Wesper for windows.

If you plan to spend some days in Tuscany (Italy) on september 
22nd and 23rd, don't forget to visit Empoli. On saturday 
22nd at 16.00h AROS will be presented 
at `Pianeta Amiga 2007`__ show.

Some other nice applications had been ported on AROS. We've recently 
got MUIbase, a relational database and `Hively Tracker`__, an AHX 
format mod editor. You may find both in the `Archives`__ as usual.
