64-BIT AROS!
------------

`Michal Schulz`__ has made the miracle, and a whole new chapter in AROS
history begins. Starting from today, you can grab the 64 bit native
flavour of AROS from our website. This new version is obviously more
advanced than the usual one, and has limited memory protection and
loading boot modules. A initial wall for 4 GB of RAM will be removed
as soon as proper MMU handling is done. In order to run the 64 bit
native version of AROS a 64-bit x86 processor like AMD Athlon 64 or 
latest Intel Core2 is needed.


VmwAROS
-------

A new AROS distribution has born. `VmwAROS`__ is a pre-installed and 
pre-configured AROS environment for VMware, compatible with Windows
and Linux versions of VMware Player, Server and Workstation (v5 or 6).
This distribuion is still far from being complete, however a initial
`beta`__ has been released for everyone daring to download and test it.
VmwAROS targets everyday's users and coders, and anyone interested in
trying AROS, but don't want to jeopardize the data on their hard drive.

Other news
----------

Aros-Exec's user Fishy_fis has announced a new AROS distribution 
called Velocity *(dead link removed)*. An initial beta should be released soon. "Velocity 
will come initially in both a live booting installable CD and a VMWare 
hard disk image and contains considerably more (and custom configured) 
software than the nightly build ISOs". Screenshots are included.

Robert Norris is working on an AROS Web-browser based on Webkit, called
Traveller. While working on it, he has updated lots of AROS libraries
and already ported some useful pieces of code, like libxml2, cURL, 
OpenSSL, SQLite and more. Some informations in `his blog`__.
