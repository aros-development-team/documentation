Skinnable Wanderer
------------------

Another important step in AROS customization has been done. Darius 
Brewka and Georg Steger have added a new decor system to Wanderer, 
allowing user to edit and change themes. Damir Sijakovic's ICE theme 
has been used as an example and it is now the default theme for AROS 
nightly builds. Please look at this screenshot (full version *(dead link removed)*):

Isn't it nice? Anyway, we're trying to make AROS more stylish and 
nice to see. So any kind of artistry contribution (themes, icons, 
wallpapers, gadgets and so on) is very well accepted. Please look 
at AROS-Exec *(dead link removed)* for further information.


Incredible news
---------------

Michal Schulz is working on a keyboard driver for his USB stack. 
He has committed an initial version that should work almost well 
(should handle keys correctly, but LEDs won't work). Please 
remember that AROS is still only compatible to UHCI USB 
controllers at this stage. 

SFS filesystem now builds automatically. This allow users to mount 
and use SFS partitions in a safer and easier way. Pavel Fedin has 
updated format command to handle different filesystems. In order 
to format a SFS partition, you should create it with HDToolBox, 
change its type to SFS and give this shell command:

  FORMAT DRIVE=DH1: NAME=MyVolume

Please notice that GRUB can't boot AROS from SFS yet. So you have to 
create a little FFS (or EXT3, or FAT) partition to put kernel and boot files 
and let GRUB make its job.

Pavel is also working on a new CD filesystem called CDVDFS, which 
currently supports CD and DVD with Joliet extensions. It will be 
put into nightlies as soon as some bugs are fixed.

Matthias Rustler has updated AROS LUA to version 5.1.2. `Here`__ 
is a list of fixed bugs. Matthias has also created a new 
DepthMenu commodity. When the user right-clicks on the depth 
gadget (window`s right-edge gadget), it opens a popup menu with all open windows, 
allowing a faster selection.

Staf Verhaegen has improved support for ARexx/Regina scripts. 
There is a new rx command in AROS, waiting in CLI to execute all your 
ARexx scripts.

Thanks to Bernd Roesch, ZUNE can now use MUI4 images (.mim files). 
Pavel Fedin has fixed crash in pendisplay class when there's no 
free pens on the screen. Some new Gorilla Icons had been added 
by Paolo Besser.
