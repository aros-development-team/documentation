New name, new site
------------------

Welcome the the new AROS.org website! AROS has a new official 
name and a new face on the Internet. From now on, AROS simply 
means "AROS Research Operating System". If you're running a fan 
site, a mailing list or so about AROS, please update them to the 
new denomination.

During this first half of 2007, AROS has greatly increased its 
features, and though it isn't ready yet for a "1.0" release, it 
is far more useable today than it was a year ago. We made decisions 
and improvements over the original project, that gave AROS its own 
identity. In the meanwhile, recent events that involved Amiga Inc 
suggested us it was a good time for a name change.

In a few words: AROS is stronger now, because even if the goals
of the project remain the same, we can concentrate more efforts 
on itself.

Latest news
-----------

Michal Schulz has completed UHCI and OHCI USB supports, this means
AROS should now support USB almost on every computer. At this stage, 
only mice and keyboards are supported, but other devices are on the 
works.

Thanks to Nic Andrews, Wanderer has now option to show files by icons
instead of showing all files by default. He also added scalable wallpapers 
to the desktop and keyboard navigation in windows.

Robert Norris added write support to FAT filesystem in AROS. 
Mounting Windows partitions is still little tricky, but it works 
almost as expected. Please don't try it yet on important data.

AROS on the web
---------------

Paul J. Beel has published lots of interesting interviews about AROS 
and other lovely subjects. Please don't miss Nic Andrews *(dead link removed)* and 
DiscreetFX Bill Panagouleas *(dead link removed)* ones on The AROS Show *(dead link removed)*

Please look also at Amigamia's new community portal `AROSWorld`__ 
and, if you like, you may buy one of those lovely shirts, mugs and 
gadget with Kitty. Part of your money will be spent to help 
development.

New site design of AROS.org has been made by Tom Richards.
