AROS globalization continues! Ioannis Koniaris has translated 
`AROS.org in Greek`__.

In the last weeks we got some technical issues with our build machine,
so we apologize if you couldn't download an updated nightly. However
the problem has been resolved with a brand new build machine, set up by
Robert Norris.

Three new interesting bounties had been recently opened on TeamAROS: 
please have a look to AROS on SAM440 *(dead link removed)*, disk validator
*(dead link removed)* and creation of a new AROS distro *(dead link removed)*.

We'd really like to thank everyone involved in AROS artistry: in the 
last weeks we got lots of new wallpaper for our competition *(dead link removed)* and 
also some new `banners`__. If you're running a website, or actively 
participating to a forum, you may help AROS diffusion by using and 
linking them to (your language translation of) Aros.org.
