Progress continues steadily underground, yet nobody dares to write status
updates. :) So this one will be short and necessarily incomplete.

Today's headlines are new PCI subsystem, and PNG icons support (eye-candy lovers,
rejoice).

Hardware
--------

Michal Schulz has completed the new PCI driver, thus earning the TeamAROS *(dead link removed)*
bounty #10 *(dead link removed)*. It is hardware independent and currently has linux-i386 and
pc-i386 (native) drivers. This is a good foundation for the future PCI
device drivers. He also made a little tool that allows one to browse a list of all
PCI peripherals attached to the computer. 

Michal is now working on a nVidia graphics card driver
(TeamAROS bounty #9 *(dead link removed)*). Let's wish him good luck. :)

Johan Grip fixed some IDE bugs and is planning to do a rewrite
of the floppy and IDE drivers.
Let's wish him good luck too, as these are not the easiest pieces of
hardware to code for, given their various quirks and other chipset issues.

Nic Andrews, a welcome addition to our resident hardware hackers, is working on
CPU detection, cpu.resource and ACPI__ support
on i386, maybe the first step on a long road to SMP support. :)

User Interface
--------------

Adam Chodorowski changed the name of the `PreferencesWindow` class to the
shorter `PrefsWindow` and improved its implementation. He also added a
dedicated preferences application for `Wanderer`, our Workbench(TM) lookalike,
implemented by using the PrefsWindow class. It allows you to test and set your Wanderer backgrounds in a much user-friendly way than before. :)

Adam Chodorowski and Georg Steger finally completed the integration of the MorphOS__ modifications
to our `intuition.library`.

Georg Steger reworked the graphics driver subsystem to allow better
optimization, most notably under X11. As a consequence, antialiased
fonts render faster and are actually quite usable now.

He also added PNG support to the icon.library, which now can use plain 
PNG images as icons. The format used is the same as MorphOS' or AmigaOS'
with `PowerIcon patch`__, with a little extension: it also allows to use a 
PNG image to represent an icon's selected state.

David Le Corfect fixed many bugs and visual quirks in Zune. For example, now relayouting a group
doesn't cause the whole window to relayout, which makes for a much better visual experience.

Georg Steger also improved `intuition.library` so that resizing a window would not redraw the whole
window borders if not strictly needed. This, coupled with opaque window moving, again provides a much better visual experience than before.

Miscellaneous
-------------

Olivier Adam added French catalogs for all the applications in the main tree,
as well as some apps in contrib.

Nic Andrews is working together with Olivier on a multiuser permissions library
(MuFSv2 compatible), for which he did a GUI login Zune class.
As if it was not enough, he's also devoting some time to the following ports:
lwIP network stack (with help from Adam Chodorowski and earlier work from
Sebastian Bauer), ODBC library, Bochs and finally Mesa 6.

Nate Downes is now working on TeamAROS bounty #12 *(dead link removed)*, FAT32 filesystem.

Michal Shulz and Frederic Requin started working on TeamAROS bounty #11 *(dead link removed)*,
which aims at rewriting the device driver that is in charge of handling ATA/ATAPI devices, to make it faster
and more reliable. Johan Grip will be helping them out along the way.

Wez Furlong, a long time lurker of the AROS-Dev mailing list, has 
finally decided to come out of the bag and show up what brave man he 
is: he has taken up on the TeamAROS bounty #3 *(dead link removed)*, which requires him
to write a complete TCP/IP stack!

Iain Templeton committed his usual fixes to make AROS hosted compile and work also on FreeBSD, and
he also fixed a bug__ in the timer.device.

Fabio Alemagna fixed some bugs in the libc, and made the necessary changes to the AROS system
header files so that C++ programs can use them seamlessy. He also fixed a bug in dos.library/ExAll() and did some improvements to the build system.

Documentation
-------------

David Le Corfec wrote some documentation about AROS debugging__, and began a Zune
`developer guide`__.

Screenshots
-----------

Finally, not even this time we could miss to provide you with a couple 
of nice screenshots to show off some of the more visually appealing 
features implemented during the latest months, so here__ they are, 
enjoy them!
