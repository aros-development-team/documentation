Ok ok, a Status Update is overdue, we know that already, no need to remind 
us ;-) In the meantime, let me announce an important fact: thanks to 
Paolo Besser, this month's edition of the best selling Italian PC game magazine, 
TGM *(dead link removed)*, is shipping with a copy of AROS on its DVD *(dead link removed)*,
a review of AROS and a full blown tutorial which will guide you trough the process
of installing AROS on an hard disk.

You can find a copy of the turorial here_ (Italian only).
