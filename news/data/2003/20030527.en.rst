Status Update
=============

Another whole month has gone by, which means that it's definitely time for
another status update. Doh, why do have all the status updates to begin
like that? :) I'd like to thank all the people who showed interest in AROS
in the last months, and there have been a lot ! Anyway, let's not wait longer,
here are the juicy bits, in this relatively uneventful month ...

Hardware
--------

Johan Grip received the Pegasos board at the end of April, installed Debian
GNU/Linux on it, and started working on the hosted AROS port. However he was
no longer able to continue for personal reasons, so he sent the board to
Michal Schulz, another talented hardware hacker.

In the meantime, Michal, who already had a PPC PReP board, worked on the native
PPC port. He merged his sources in the AROS CVS tree, creating the new
'arch/ppc' directory. To this day, he went as far as implementing task handling
and scheduling. Congratulations Michal! Sources as well as a PReP boot image
can be found at *(dead link removed)*

Michal is also reworking exec.library to make it hardware/platform-independent,
by moving dependent stuff in resources like kernel.resource, OpenFirmware.resource ...

Build system
------------

No fundamental changes to this sometimes hated system, but lots and
lots of little bug fixes and improvements by almost every active AROS Team
member in tools, config files, makefiles ... So much activity caused quite
a few broken nightly builds, but it seems now stabilized.

Also the newer gcc 3.3 that got installed on the build machine led to some
problems, but nothing that couldn't be handled.

We now use bzip2 instead of gzip, and a custom, simpler package format than
tar to create the AROS floppy and squeeze every possible byte. In the quest
to more space, some less useful programs were removed from floppy. Thanks
to Adam Chodorowski for the cleanup and optimizations!

i386-pc Installation
--------------------

The installer for the i386 native port, install-i386-pc, is currently broken,
but a graphical bootsector installer is in work, as well as a bootmenu editor,
courtesy of Sebastian Heutling, who also still works on the HDToolBox partition
editor.

User Interface
--------------

Adam Chodorowski began to work on the Zune custom class PreferencesWindow.mcc
which implements the AROS standard prefs window buttons and look.

Paul Smith continued his huge work on the next iteration of Wanderer and the
underlying desktop.library. It draws icons, and different views are
possible (large icons, small icons, details).

Fabio Alemagna added horizontal and vertical color gradients to Zune images.
Take a look at the obligatory screenshot__!

By default, the Boot Shell is now closed after Wanderer is started. To open
a new shell, use the Wanderer/Shell menu item, or use Amiga-W shortcut
(Amiga key is the right Win key on pc105 keyboards)

Localizations
-------------

Thanks to Olivier Adam for his French translation of dos.library catalog,
and to Paulo Silva for the Portuguese keyboard description (which Georg
Steger implemented).

Miscellaneous
-------------

Some miscellaneous things that have happened:

+ Staf Verhaegen continued to work on diskfont.library.
+ Stefan Berger worked hard on ports of gtlayout.library and term 4.7,
  which can be found in contrib.
+ Adam Chodorowski imported AHI 5.8 in AROS CVS, following Martin Blom's
  release of the AROS port.
+ Georg Steger worked on the unix hosted kernel to allow nesting supervisor,
  so that signals occuring during a signal handler execution are not ignored.
  It should improve the stability of the serial device.
+ and of course, lots of fixes here and there by many developers : for a rough
  idea, already more than 350 CVS commits this month (although we won't beat
  the record of 890 last month, according to the AROS-CVS mailing list
  archive).

Documentation
-------------

AROS documentation, in source and HTML-rendered form, is now available on the
download page.
