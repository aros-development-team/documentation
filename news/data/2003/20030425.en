Status Update
=============

Almost another whole months has gone by, which means that it's definitely time
for another status update. I'm sure you're all perched for information about
what's happening with AROS. ;-)


Hardware
--------

Ports
"""""

Matthew Parsons contacted Genesi *(dead link removed)* and asked if they would be interested in
sponsoring a Pegasos board to get AROS ported to it, and they thought it was a
great idea! After some discussion on the ML and hard thinking on Johan Grip's 
part, he decided to accept the offer and try his utmost to port AROS to the 
Pegasos. All agree that he's the best suited for this task. The Pegasos board
is at the time of writing on it's way to Johan. Hopefully this will result in 
AROS running on it in the near future!

Stefan Berger did some more work on the m68k-pp (Palm) port, which include 
bits of an input driver for the touchscreen and several fixes. He also 
committed parts of a native ARM port (it's not complete, and there are no 
promises that he will continue working on it).



Drivers
"""""""

When it comes to drivers, several things have happened:

+ Georg Steger has worked hard on improving the stability in ide.device and 
  cdrom.handler. The former had several ugly race conditions, which could 
  result in bad things happening if several programs tried to access the disk
  at the same time. Also added was better support for removable drives. As for
  cdrom.handler, there were several bugs in the startup routines and the 
  filesystem interface (which meant ``PROGDIR:`` didn't work for programs 
  started from CDROM).

+ Sebastian Heutling commited parts of a USB/UHCI driver, but it is far from 
  being usable at this point. Before it makes sense to develop it further more
  work has to be done on the general driver architecture in AROS. 
  
+ Martin Blom found some free time and ported AHI__, although there are no 
  drivers yet (except for the filesave and dummy ones). This is a great step
  forward for providing sound support to AROS! Writing a driver for hosted 
  should be fairly simple (the only problem is time, as always) and it will 
  probably the first one. You can see the preferences program running in a
  screenshot_.

User Interface
--------------

On the user interface front, there has been discussions about using 
render.library and guigfx.library in Zune, picture.datatype and other places
that would benefit greatly from them. The author was very positive to this,
and render.library already has been ported long ago (although it has some 
endianness issues).

There was also a heated discussion on the mailing list about which buttons 
should be available in prefs programs, since there was a feeling that the 
traditional Save/Use/Cancel triad of AmigaOS is not enough. After a *lot* of
discussion, it was finally decided on a compromise where the Save/Use/Cancel
buttons where kept but the additional Test/Revert buttons (which don't close
the window) was added.

Other developments of interest:

+ David Le Corfec, Georg Steger and Sebastian Bauer continued to code on Zune
  and made the Test button in the prefs program work, added a bitmap preview
  in the imageadjust dialog and worked on a experimental feature to reduce
  the flickering when resizing windows.

+ David Le Corfec managed to dig up some artistic skills and created some new
  def_Tool and def_Project icons to replace the 4-color ones. Some days later, 
  Martin "Mason" Mertz contributed several more icons, including ones for 
  def_Tool and def_Project. ;-) Some nice striped patterns were also created
  by David. Have a look at the screenshot_.

+ Georg Steger fixed a bug in the hosted flavour which meant that the X SHM
  extension always was disabled. The graphics performance should now be a bit
  better.


Datatypes
---------

Thanks to Martin Gierich who wrote jpeg.datatype based on libjpeg__ and 
Georg Steger who wrote png.datatype based on libpng__, AROS now supports most
popular image formats! The png.datatype supports transparency with indexed
(256 colors or less) images. You can see them in action in the screenshot_.

Miscellaneous
-------------

Some miscellaneous things that have happened:

+ Staf Verhaegen merged the diskfont.library sources with the MorphOS version,
  and then continued with reworking it in several ways. 

+ Georg Steger fixed a bug in Locale Prefs which caused random crashes on 
  i386-pc (but oddly enough not on hosted).
  
+ Fabio Alemagna fixed several bugs all over the place, after Martin Blom 
  reported them during the course of porting AHI.

+ Stefan Berger worked some more on the port of gtlayout.library in contrib,
  aiming on being able to port Term in the future. He also ported another 
  contrib program: MUImine (a rather nice minesweeper game clone).

+ Fabio Alemagna ported `LBreakout 2`__, which is a very nice and polished 
  breakout style game that uses SDL. There are however some problems when
  running in windowed mode or in 16bit screen depth (works fine in 24bit modes
  though). Take a look at the screenshot__!
  
+ Olivier Adam wrote French translations for many programs.

Repository Cleanup
-------------------

During the last month there has also been an effort to clean up the CVS 
repository, mostly spear-headed by Adam Chodorowski. Basically there are two
parts to this effort: 

1. Make sure that all software in the main tree follows the 
   `licensing policy`__ (which entails checking the copyright and making sure 
   the license are compatible with the APL, and make sure it is documented).
   
2. Moving software that we want to be part of the standard AROS distribution
   from contrib to the main tree, and moving things that don't belong in the 
   main tree to contrib.

The following things have resulted from this effort:

+ The authors of FlexCat, which we use in development, have been contacted to 
  clarify the license since the documentation is very vague about it. They 
  confirmed that it is indeed licensed under the 
  `GNU General Public License (GPL)`__.

+ GRUB__ (our bootloader for i386-pc), libjpeg, jpeg.datatype, libbz2 (bzip2__
  compression library) and JanoEditor (nice text editor which will become the
  standard one in AROS) have been moved from contrib to the main tree. On the
  other hand, liblcc (part of the LCC__ compiler) has been moved from the main 
  tree to contrib. Aaron  Digulla did the actual moving directly on the CVS 
  server, to avoid loosing the CVS history.

  In the near future more software will most likely be moved to the main 
  tree, like Regina (to provide ARexx compatibility), FreeType__ 2 (support 
  for scalable TrueType fonts), libpng and png.datatype.

Documentation
-------------

After a consensus had been reached in the discussion about buttons in prefs 
programs, Adam Chodorowski decided to write the first part of the AROS `User
Interface Style Guide`__ about this topic. It's still a long way from being 
a comprehensive guide on user interface issues, but at least it's a start.
