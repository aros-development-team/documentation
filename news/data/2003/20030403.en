=============
Status Update
=============

:Author: Fabio Alemagna
:Date:   2003-04-03

Long time has passed since the latest real status update, and we're sorry about it,
but be sure that development hasn't stopped, and many things have happened in the AROS
realm in the last few months.


New Site
--------

Let's begin with what you can see right now: the new site__. As already announced a few
days ago, AROS has gained a new and awesome web site, thanks to Adam Chodorowski and
Daniel Holmen. The new site has a set of nice features which make it easier to navigate
and get the informations one is looking for.

In a not particular order, the new site features:

    - new and updated documentation, which should greatly help people understand what AROS is
      really about (believe me, there's a widespread general misconception about this issue)
      and provide with useful references about development__ *for* AROS and *of* AROS itself,
      together with information more geared towards users__.

    - a much better `download section`__, from which nightly builds and CVS snapshots
      of the AROS sources can be downloaded.

    - our new mascot, Kitty__, whose father is the great `Eric W. Schwartz`__:
      isn't she cute? ;-)

    - a set of new screenshots_.


GUI
---

On the Graphic User Interface front there have also been many improvements.

    - Zune [1]_, for instance, has been greatly improved, and its skinning features are
      just brilliant. Have a look at the `screenshots page`__ to get an idea of what
      I'm talking about.

    - freetype 2 has been ported to AROS, by Staf Verhaegen, on the basis of the work already
      done by the MOS_ Team.

    - Wanderer [2]_, while still being mostly experimental, has finally got smooth window scrolling,
      which should improve its usability a lot. It must be said, though, that the current Wanderer
      was meant to be more a proof of concept than anything, and apart from the initial development,
      which lasted only a couple of days, not much has been done about it. A more powerful incarnation
      of the Wanderer concept is in the work by Paul Smith.

    - Many more `Mason Icons`__ have been included in the AROS builds, making the overall wanderer
      experience more pleasant. Many thanks go to Martin "Mason" Mertz for providing us with his
      excellent work!


Drivers
-------

There are news also from the device drivers front, thanks to Johan Grip.

    - The ide.device has finally seen solved the geometry recognition issue:
      now it should be able to detect the geometry of your hardrive correctly in all cases.
      Unfortunately, what seems to be an easy job at a glance, shows to be a dirty one when
      looking at it more deeply, due to problems related to CHS/LBA representation.
      Or so Johan says. :-)

    - We've got a *VESA2* driver, which makes it possible to use high resolutions and high depth values
      in the native flavour of AROS. Georg Steger has, moreover, optimized the drawing routines
      a lot, making the whole experience of using AROS at full resolution and full depth a very
      pleasant one. Try it by yourself, by running a few demos.


Applications
------------

AROS doesn't have a wide set of applications yet, however it has a few cute ones, and some of them
have seen great improvements during the last months.

    - HDToolBox [3]_ has seen many bugs fixed and its GUI improved. For the ones that
      don't know yet, thanks to the partition.library [4]_, HDToolBox handles both RDB and MBR
      partitioning models, and it allows for nested partitions, even of different models.

    - Staf Verhaegen has managed to port Regina_, a free and portable REXX interpreter, to AROS,
      making it fully compatible with AREXX.

    - The AROS port of python_, maintained by Adam Chodorowski, has a site__ of its own now,
      and got the name of *PyAROS*.


Miscellaneous
-------------

A lot more things have been improved in AROS in the latest months and many bugs have been fixed, in
many modules, so it would be rather hard listing all of them. However, there are a few things really worth
mentioning which don't fit in any specific category and which I am going to list here.

    - The ELF [5]_ loader has been completely refactored, all of its bugs are now gone and it's
      significantly faster and cleaner. AROS has also obtained official recognition by the SCO
      group, and thus got an official ELFOSABI [6]_ number: *15*.

      The ELF loader is a work of Fabio Alemagna.

    - Martin Gierich has continued his work on the picture.datatype, after a very long pause,
      and made it finally handle true color pictures. He also updated the ilbm datatype
      accordingly.

    - Always on the datatypes front, Daniel Holmen has developed a bmp datatype. However,
      when the bmp datatype was made Martin hadn't updated the picture datatype yet, so
      the bmp datatype doesn't handle true color pictures.

    - The FreeBSD port is now working, after a long period of time during which AROS would
      not compile or would not work properly on FreeBSD. Thanks to Iain Templeton for fixing it
      and Georg Steger for doing his usual bug hunting. :)

    - Fabio Alemagna has begun working on an SDK for AROS, including a set of cross and native development
      tools, with specific AROS optimizations. So far the cross-binutils are almost ready, and patches
      have already been submitted to the binutils crew, expect an AROS SDK to be released to the public
      soon.

Conclusions
-----------

Although in the past months we've been really silent, development has continued without interruption.
However, progress is not as fast as we all would like it to be, and this is mainly due to lack of
developers: *"AROS - So much to do, so little time"* is the motto that has been invented in the
#aros IRC channel on freenode_ to describe this situation. :-)

So, as we always say, we need **more** developers! Come on guys, AROS is fun, let's have fun together!

----------

.. [1] Zune is our MUI_ clone, a project originated by David Le Corfec, and after some time
       taken into AROS, and since then developed by David, Sebastian Bauer, Georg Steger
       and Fabio Alemagna.

.. [2] Wanderer is our Workbench(TM) clone.

.. [3] HDToolBox is our partitioning tool. Its author is Sebastian Heutling.

.. [4] Partition.library is a library which handles different partitioning models in an unified way.
       So far it supports RDB and MBR partitioning models, but it is made to be easily extended.
       Partition.library is a work of Sebastian Heutling.

.. [5] ELF stands for "Executable and Linking Format", and it's the format of choice for AROS
       executables.

.. [6] The ELFOSABI is a number that uniquely identifies an operating system and connects it to
       a particular ELF object. In other words, an ELF object which has in its header a particular
       ELFOSABI number, is meant to be run only on the operating system which owns that number.
