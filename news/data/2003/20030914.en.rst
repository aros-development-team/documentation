Martin Steigerwald wrote an article *(dead link removed)* about AROS for the German publication
Amiga-Magazin. Thanks Martin !

While I'm there, AROS automated builds were often missing during
the past month, due to a bug (not AROS-related) in binutils which prevented
the native version to link properly, and then due to changes in our libc.
However these particular issues are now solved !
