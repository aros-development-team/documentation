As we just got a working native port of the GCC compiler, it's time
to browse 3 months of posts and commitlogs, and to make an attempt at
a digest :)

Hardware
--------

Michal Schulz has advanced the Pegasos/PPC native port: working bootup.resource,
partially written openfirmware.resource, full exec.library, full oop.library
(though some conflicts remain with kernel.resource), partial kernel.resource
(external interrupts are not handled at the moment, and thus the scheduler
doesn't have a timer which could feed it). Unfortunately he won't be able
to work much on AROS during the next few months.

Sebastian Heutling has worked on the Linux/PPC hosted port, up to the point
where AROS can be nearly built out of the box, except for a couple of
math libraries.

Native C/C++ compiler
---------------------

Fabio Alemagna did it *(dead link removed)*! After a month of hard work to improve our C library
(POSIX semantics handling) and to port the huge beast known as GCC, we
now have a working port of GCC 3.3.1. Thanks to TeamAROS *(dead link removed)* and to the
donors, Fabio won a deserved bounty.
No more excuses to not port your Amiga programs to AROS, be them coded
in C or C++ :) Help with ports of various \*nix utilities is also welcome.

The next goal? Probably to have a POSIX environment complete enough to be able
to recompile GCC within AROS itself.


User Interface
--------------

Adam Chodorowski and Georg Steger integrated back a recent version of MorphOS
intuition library.

Georg Steger implemented a lot of missing Zune (our GUI toolkit) classes:
Dirlist, Volumelist, Poplist, Popscreen, Levelmeter, Crawling, Knob.
He also implemented help bubbles.

The Installer utility now has a Zune GUI and supports localization, thanks
to the work of Henning Kiel.

Fabio Alemagna and Adam Chodorowski have worked on a GUI for UAE
(Amiga emulator), which is still work in progress but coming along well :).

Miscellaneous
-------------

+ Sebastian Heutling fixed the AFS filesystem, which solved many problems under
  i386-native, eg. during the AROS installation. Also his work has been supported
  by TeamAROS *(dead link removed)*.

+ Staf Verhaegen continued his streamlining of the build system, and also fixed
  some issues with the diskfont library.

+ Iain Templeton is working on BSD based TCP/IP stack. As a side effect,
  he improved the compatibility of our C library with existing standards.

+ Sebastian Bauer is working on an Amiga and AROS port of lwIP, a lightweight
  TCP/IP stack primarily designed for embedded systems.

+ As usual, lots of bugs and other leaks have been corrected here and there.
  Special mention to Georg Steger for his awesome bug fixing abilities!

+ This is only a digest, lots of changes and additions have been silently
  ignored in this report. Full story is available through our CVS commitlogs
  mail archive.

Screenshots
-----------

As usual, along with this status update there are new screenshots
showing some of the new stuff that has been done in the latest few months. You can find
them here__.

--------

TeamAROS *(dead link removed)* showed to be a great success, many bounties *(dead link removed)*
have been successfully completed
and more are waiting to be picked up. Be sure to check their page *(dead link removed)* out and see if there's
any bounties you'd like to donate to, or even start a bounty of your own!
