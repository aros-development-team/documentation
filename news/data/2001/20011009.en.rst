Kjetil Svalastog Matheussen added a startup script which starts Radium
and removed a debug line which caused Radium to crash. He also
committed a patch for realtime.library hunting for a bug which caused
Radium to break. And he fixed a bug in the sliderclass in
gadtools.library (would return the smallest value when at the
top).
