Aaron Digulla fixed a bug which broke the nightly builds and Michael
Schulz began to commit the new AROS Native/i386 core. AROS uses now
GRUB to boot. Georg Steger began to implement the ASL Font requester.
He and Johan Alfredsson also fixed a few compiler warnings.
To test the new font requester, Georg committed some PD TrueType
fonts.
Peter Hans van den Muijzenberg improved the ideas for a MMU.HIDD.
