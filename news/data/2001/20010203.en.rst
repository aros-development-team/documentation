Georg Steger added the country specific files for all countries
which are supported by the AmigaOS and some more languages.
In the last few days, he made also many demo programs from
Aminet, Fish Disks and other sources work much better (or
at all :-).

Stefan Berger finished GetLanguageSelection() in lowlevel.library.

Johan Alfredsson improved realtime.library and Swedish locale
files.
