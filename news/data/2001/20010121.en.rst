Kjetil Svalastog Matheussen fixed a couple of bugs in the
new camd.library and wrote an example MIDI driver for it.
Johan Alfredsson began work on the last datatypes.library function
(LaunchToolA()).

Georg Steger fixed a really very old bug in the task switching
core of AROS (FPU context wasn't correctly saved).
