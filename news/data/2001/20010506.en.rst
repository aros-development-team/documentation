Georg Steger disabled some more debug output, optimized drawing of
a resizes console window, added support for the WAIT argument in the
console filename, fixed a typo in stdio.h and fopen(). And he
implemented more CSI sequences and fixed some existing ones. RAW
mode is mostly implemented (WaitForChar() doesn't work, yet).
MicroEmacs from the Fish disks works now.
