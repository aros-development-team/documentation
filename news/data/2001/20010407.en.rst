Lars Bischoff cleaned the code for DisplayBeep() so all screens beep at
the same time, now :-)

Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla committed some more stuff for the new web site.

Georg Steger made additional changes to the build system for libraries
with strange names and base types. He also fixed the problem with the
race condition in IPrefs (with some help from Johan Alfredsson :-).
