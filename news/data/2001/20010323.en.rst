Johan Alfredsson fixed the emulation of ACTION_ADD_NOTIFY, ACTION_REMOVE_NOTIFY
and ACTION_MAKE_LINK.

Stefan Berger continued to improve archtool and comitted the sources
for shutdown.library from Aminet.

AROS now boots into the shell instead of waiting in SAD for the user
to start it. With the floppy code, you can now boot AROS from a floppy
disk and actually do something useful with it :-) Horay !
