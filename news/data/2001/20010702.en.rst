Henning Kiel added Freetype, rexx and some gfx utils to the standard
build. He also fixed a lot of warnings in windowtool from FishDisks.

Georg Steger fixed a bug in fdsk.device and he added a ramdisk.device
(RAD:) based on fdsk.device. He also added proper deadkey handling in
MapRawKey() and fixed a linker problem in windowtool. windowtool
works now.
