Kjetil Svalastog Matheussen improved the PolyDraw() routine a bit.
And he fixed demowin which used this routine in a wrong way.
Radium is now part of the default build. Doesn't work completely,
yet, though.

Peter Eriksson worked on Font prefs (fixed a typo in the Swedish
translation) and the ReqTools pref (the Escape key, Ctrl-C and the
close button now close the window).

Nicholai Benalal began to merge MorphOS patches into asl.library.

Adam Chodorowski began porting Python__, the first real programming 
language for AROS. He can already run simple scripts. Good work! Now 
we'll see if we can squeeze enough space out of the bootdisk to include 
it :-) He also fixed a bug in strchr().

Fabio Alemagna implemented umask().
