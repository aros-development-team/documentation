October saw two interesting new developements in Linux hosted
AROS landscape. First, Krzysztof Smiechowicz started implementation
of audio driver based in ALSA subsystem. Linux hosted AROS has
been without sound for a long time - since the OSS system in Linux has
been deprecated. First alpha version has been released. Driver is
developed based on a bounty. Secondly, Jyrki Koivisto began work
on USB driver that communicates with Linux usb subsystem and makes USB
devices available from Poseidon.

Neil Cafferkey continued his work on Zune, AROS MUI replacement, by
adding more test cases focusing on MUI List and Listview classes.
Together with extending the tests, a few small fixes have been implemented.

Last but not least, Oliver Brunner ported traceroute utility based
on request from community.

Outside of AROS Development Team, the community received updates to two AROS
distributions. Olaf Schoenweiss updated his AROS m68k distribution "AROS
Vision" to version 2.6.9. and Pascal Papara released another preview
build of his AROS i386 distribution "AROS Broadway", working towards version
1.0. Pascal also achieved one more nice milestone with 500 users being
registered in his cross platform IndieGO AppStore that is available also
for AROS.
