Latest updates
--------------

Many things happened since the latest status update.

Michal Schulz developed the GMA950 hidd, so AROS can now use 2D native functions of the latest GPUs from Intel. This will be really handy for 
people using Stephen Jones' iMica systems and netbooks like the Acer 
Aspire One A150. 

Krzysztof "Deadwood" Smiechowicz has gone really far with his Gallium3D 
port to AROS: he has now integrated 2D and 3D accelerated functions in a 
single driver called Nouveau, which supports 2D acceleration for almost 
all GeForce GPUs starting from the ancient GeForce 2 cards
until the recent GTX 200 
series. 3D functions, however, are available only to GeForce FX (5x00), 
cards and upwards. Some models and GPUs might not be supported yet.
Users of Nvidia cards may now regularily use this driver, 
instead of the old Nvidia one. This will also help 
Krzysztof fixing it, as it is still work-in-progress. Please refer to this
AROS-EXEC topic *(dead link removed)* to help him spotting and fixing bug (and please
remember he's not directly responsible for driver quality: he's just 
adapting and porting to AROS what has been done by Nouveau/Gallium team).

Pavel Fedin is reworking our graphics subsystem, cleaning it up and 
making it behave like the original Amiga one: the day we won't need anymore
to enter driver names in GRUB boot lines is approaching. Some 
drivers can now be mounted moving them in the Monitors directory (like 
on AmigaOS), while others not yet. But he's still working on it. Pavel 
is also fixing linux framebuffer driver and his Win32-hosted version of 
AROS, which can now move screens like classic Amigas.

Neil Cafferkey has vastly improved our support to FAT partitions, and 
also made AROS installable on USB pendrives (and bootable from them). 
This means that regular nightly builds, but also `Icaros Destop version 
1.2.2`__ can now be installed on netbooks and
other USB-bootable systems using a memory stick instead of a DVD. Paolo
Besser has written a complete `how-to`__ in PDF format, and placed it
on the Icaros website.

Pascal Papara has brought us a brand new distribution called 
Broadway *(dead link removed)*, which is targeted to attract also people never involved with
Amiga computers, and include a 
stripped down version of the incoming AMC, the first media-center 
environment based on AmigaOS-like systems. Broadway is not complete yet, 
but a nice preview version can be downloaded from its website *(dead link removed)*.

Steve "ClusterUK" Jones has announced a new silent version of his iMica 
line of computers. This Atom-based system will be as performing as the 
old one, but it will also run completely fanless. We also have to thank 
Steve for his funding efforts: after paying Davy Wentzler for his useful 
AHI HDAudio drivers, he also financed the port of the Catweasel MKIV 
controller drivers and the development of Michal's GMA driver.

Good news for ACube's SAM440EP users too: since April 14th, AROS 
nightlies are available also for this nice PPC platform, which is still 
actively mantained. Michal Shulz has also recently brought a EFIKA 
version of AROS too.

Nick "Kalamatee" Andrews has slightly improved Wanderer and some long-
running bugs have been fixed. AROS won't nest directories recursively 
anymore, when a drawer is placed into its own window by mistake, and 
AROS desktop can now be populated using the leave out/put away options, 
which are now finally enabled. He is also working on icon and list view: 
files can now be listed by details and sorted as you prefer.

There are also many small and big enhancements ongoing "under the hood" 
and coming from third party software developers, but they are simply too 
much to be mentioned here. We apologize with them, but we'd also like to 
say a big "thank you!" to anyone helping us in any way, porting 
applications, creating new ones, writing documentation and/or just 
evangelizing AROS inside and outside the Amiga community.
