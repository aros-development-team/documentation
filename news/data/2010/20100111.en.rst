Latest updates
--------------

It's been a long time since the latest status update, however many 
things happened in the meanwhile. 

First of all, Chris "platon42" Hodges has opened the sources of his
Poseidon USB stack under the terms of the APL, and ported it to AROS: 
after some weeks of tweaking, adapting and bugfixing, AROS can now 
handle USB 1.1 and 2.0 controllers. Any USB device should be correctly
detected by the operating system, while mice, keyboards and other input
devices should be correctly handled as well. Most USB pendrives and 
storage devices work, while others don't yet, due to some fat.handler
issues we're investigating about. Other devices will be supported in
future, when someone will write the necessary drivers.

Thanks to Poseidon, AROS can now boot from USB CD-ROM and DVD-ROM 
drives. This allows installing AROS on a wide range of notebooks and
netbooks like the `Acer Aspire One A150`__. This netbook is now a fair
good hardware platform for AROS: Steve Jones and Davy Wenzler wrote a
HD Audio driver *(dead link removed)* for the iMica *(dead link removed)*
computer which covers also this
one and a wide range of Intel-compatible mainboards, and the
`Icaros Desktop`__ distribution introduced a way to get correct 
1024x600 resolution on the GMA9x0 video chip.

Przemyslaw "Qus" Szczygielski's TCPPrefs utility has been fixed and
added to the AROS prefs utilities: pokeing with script and configuration
text files is not required anymore to connect to the Internet. Matthias
Rustler has ported Scout to AROS, so closing offending windows and 
crashed applications should  be easier than before. Kernel stability
has improved a lot thanks to many fixes from Neil Cafferkey and Pavel
Fedin.

Neil Cafferkey vastly improved our ata.device, which now supports
many SATA controllers. Any SATA enabled computer which can be turned to
work as 'IDE' in the BIOS settings, however, should work with AROS.

Stanislaw Szymczyk continued to update OWB, fixing bugs and problems, 
and adding new features like bookmarks, application menu, splash 
screen, the ability to open HTML files and so on, and he's now heading
to release version 1.0 of his modern, CSS and JavaScript enabled web
browser. OWB is a quite flexible tool, since allows AROS to run most
web-enabled applications.

Yannick "Yannickescu" Erb has ported to AROS some interesting games like
Open Tyrian, Super Methane Brothers and SDL Ball, and wrote ZuneARC, a
standard and customizable Zune frontend for command-line archivers 
already available for AROS. You can find these and other interesting 
stuff on his website *(dead link removed)*. Some nice games have been ported also by 
AROS_EXEC.org user Fishy_fis. Don't miss his DOSBox port to AROS!

Simone "samo" Bevilacqua ported his Amiga game BOH to AROS, and it behaves
nicely! `BOH`__ is the first commercial game available for the new Amiga
platforms.

Krzysztof "Deadwood" Smiechowicz ported version 7.5 of MESA to AROS, and
is adding hardware 3D acceleration capabilities to AROS with his ongoing
port of Gallium3D. For now, he has just released an alpha demo *(dead link removed)*
of this technology running on GeForce FX, 6 and 7 series video cards. A
nice video showing the GLExcess demo running on AROS is here__.

Paolo Besser has released version 1.2 of the Icaros Desktop distribution.
The new version includes the ability to `run old Amiga games`__ straight
from their ADF files, thanks to some new AmiBridge scripts and a old
version of E-UAE. In the meanwhile, Oliver Brunner has improved Janus-UAE
integration, allowing AROS to run AmigaOS 3.x applications inside AROS
windows. To do both things, however, users must provide a working 
installation of AmigaOS 3.x and original kickstart, maybe using Cloanto's
`Amiga Forever`__.

Behind the scene Staf Verhaegen is still working on a new standardized
ABI for AROS. Hopefully the moon and the sun will be right one day this
year and the ABI can see the light of day.
