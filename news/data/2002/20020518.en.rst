Before I turn to the other batch of news which has accumulated over the
last month: Our machine is going to be moved once more and that means it's
going to be unavailable for a few days (I guess you're already used to this;
it happened once or twice every year :-)

So don't worry when aros.org doesn't work after 22.05.2002. It will be up
again, soon.
