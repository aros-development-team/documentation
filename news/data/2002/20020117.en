The big news of the day? Look at this URL: `https://aros.sourceforge.io/`__.
Yes, AROS is now one of the many, many, many (more than 32000 last time I 
looked) projects on SourceForge__! That means we can probably solve many of our 
bandwidth problems. :-) You can find the normal SourceForge project page 
here__. We're now integrating most of the links and stuff from our own homepage 
into the SF system.

Georg Steger continued to port changes by Stephan Rupprecht back into AROS. 
This time, it's the OS 3.9 gradientslider. Also, a bug in InstallClipRegion() 
was fixed. He added a safety check in the ReqTools file requester to prevent a 
possible recursive hook call and several other bugfixes in there. Our ReqTools 
is now V39.4.

Adam Chodorowski overworked the build of Python for AROS (only one big 
MMakefile is used now which is more flexible and clean than what we had 
before).

Henning Kiel fixed a the build script for adflib to work on Cygwin and made the 
build process less verbose.
