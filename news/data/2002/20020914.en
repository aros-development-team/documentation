Sebastian Heutling implemented an intuition-based boot menu on AROS/x86 native.
You can now choose to boot with or without executing the startup-sequence. The
plans for this menu also include enabling HIDD switching at boot time.

Georg Steger fixed some text formatting bugs in graphics.library. He also
renamed con-handler to con.handler to be consistent, and implemented
eac_MatchString/MatchFunc in ExAll (DOS). He added an assign HOME: in AROS/linux
to point to the current user's home directory.
