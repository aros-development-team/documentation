The clipboard.device, written by Johan Alfredsson is now
ready (kudos for fixing the last bugs and testing it go
to Georg Steger). Also, we have now ConClip.

We also have a working datatypes.library (for a while now)
but Georg Steger has ported some datatypes (text and ascii
to be precise) from Aminet. The binary datatype will be next
and maybe we'll have a picture.datatype soon, too.
