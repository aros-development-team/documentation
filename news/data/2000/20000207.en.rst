Code for Menus has been comitted. Unlike on the Amiga, Menus are handled
by a normal task which gets all input events as long as the user presses
the right mousebutton. Therefore, menus don't block, they are very easily
enhanced and the input handler is much more simple. And if blocking menus
ever become an issue, this can added on a per-program basis by looking for
RMB down/up.
