There are still problems to build AROS Native/i386 with EGCS (GCC 2.95.2) which
should be resolved, soon. Some more screenshots__ have been added. It's DOOM, this
time. Unlike other Amiga ports of DOOM, DOOM can be run several times on AROS
and you can even play multiplayer games on one machine (not very useful,
though: The keyboard is just too small for four players :-).
