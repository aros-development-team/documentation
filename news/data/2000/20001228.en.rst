Georg Steger worked a bit more in the backport of reqtools to AmigaOS.
Johan Alfredsson implemented DisplayError() and Stefan Berger improved
his layers.library. DisplayBeep() works now and Henning Kiel committed
a small utility (C:Beep) to use it from the shell. Adam Chodorowski
continued his work on the workbench.library.
