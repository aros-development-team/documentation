This is the first status update of 2006, and we wish to thank all AROS
users, sponsors and enthusiasts for their support: at the beginning of
2005 AROS-Exec *(dead link removed)* had about 250 members, now this number has doubled
with more than 500 (and growing). During these months AROS has achieved
some key goals such as network support, CVS to Subversion migration and
PPC porting. More and more applications had been ported or added, lots
of bugs have been fixed, and there's also a flavour of AROS running on
top of classic AmigaOS, in order to modernize it. We're all sure that
2006 will be a very interesting year for AROS. And now, let's go with
our fresh news...

Georg Steger has fixed input preferences for mouse, in order to improve
mice tracking and pointer precision on the screen.

Matthias Rustler has updated documentation for users and developers,
adding some nice hints and removing obsolete informations. You'll find
signs of his work throughout this site. Matthias has also commited
ExecuteStartup, a little tool that executes whatever application you'll
copy in the SYS:WBstartup drawer.


Networking
----------

Thanks to Nick Andrews and Jack Patton AROS has got IRC and Telnet
clients. In order to enable networking on hosted version of AROS,
Michal Schulz has commited a .tap interface hidd for all Unix targets.
