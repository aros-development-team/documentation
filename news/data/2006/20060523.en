Internationally AROS
--------------------

Thanks to Neil Cafferkey, Adam Chodorowski, Daniel Holmen and Paolo Besser, 
aros.org has now its Finnish and Italian counterparts. Translations of 
this website are now available at these nice new addresses:

`Finnish aros.org`__
`Italian aros.org`__

Finnish translation is almost complete, while Italian one is still 
a work in progress. Aros.org does support German translation too, but only a
few pages are already available. If you wish to contribute localizations of 
our web pages, well... please apply to the development mailing list.

AROS means art
--------------

Hogne "M0ns00n" Titlestad has released Lunapaint v0.2 for i386/AROS. 
The app can save and open projects, make animations and export images. 
Initial stability issues in hosted AROS has been resolved, and Lunapaint works fine 
also on native. You can see screenshots `here`__ and read a nice interview 
on `The Aros Show`__. Download it from the `Archives`__!

Other news
----------

Mathias Roslund has ported the famous Commodore 8-bit computers line emulator 
VICE to all Amiga platforms, AROS included. Please note that the AROS 
version is still highly experimental. You may find it `here`__.

Tomasz Wiszkowski has ported `FryingPan`__ and `CoFEE`__ to AROS. FryingPan 
is CD/DVD burner software, while CoFEE is a CD/DVD copy program. 
They work partially on AROS due to lack of ATAPI and SCSI commands. 
In order to speed up their implementation, TeamAROS has 
started a `new bounty`__

Randy Vice and Oliver Adams have completely renewed the `TeamAROS`__ website,
with more stylish graphics and a brand new service: Bounty Subscriptions. Now 
"you can support TeamAROS by a monthly subscription of $5 USD or $10 USD and 
that gives you a vote on TeamAROS-Benefactors ML on which bounty deserves that 
month's cash donation. This is a painless method since PayPal will deduct the 
money automatically each month. Set and forget, can't be made much easier 
than that"

Bernd Roesch and Georg Steger are fixing bugs and adding new features to Zune, 
while other AROS developers are still working hard on other issues of the 
operating system.
