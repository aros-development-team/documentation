Radeon hidd
-----------

Michal Schulz has done it again: the day every ATI fanboy was waiting for
has finaly come! AROS has got its Radeon driver - pardon - hidd, so it's now
possible to access Radeon cards directly and forget the old VESA modes. All
Radeon owners are encouraged to download tonight's nightly build and test it.

AROS-EXEC.org down
------------------

Due to a change of IP address, our community's website aros-exec.org is
temporarily down. We apologize for that. The website, its forum and services
will be back around March 29th, better and stronger than before.
