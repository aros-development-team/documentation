Status update

Our latest status update is about three months old, but in the meanwhile
we didn't sit somewhere doing nothing. Lots of improvements and bugfixes
have been made to several components of AROS, in order to make it work
better.

Nightly builds for the PPC-hosted flavor of AROS are finally available 
in our `download page`__.

Christoph Szczecina added initial support for drag'n'drop file 
copying to Wanderer, allowing a smarter approach to file management. 
This initial commit allows copying only a single file from one 
directory to another, but it's a beginning. Beta testers may find 
this new feature in the latest nightly builds. Other developers 
added window position saving and icon listing support.

Staf Verhaegen is updating developers' documentation. Lots of things 
have changed in the last 24 months and our manual pages were just a 
little outdated. Thanks to Staf, new AROS developers may find 
useful information on this website.

Thanks to Bernd Roesch and Georg Steger, all important features 
needed to replace MUI in most Amiga programs have been added to 
Zune. Michal Schulz added write support to the PNG datatype, making icon
and image editing easier on AROS.

AROS in the news
----------------

OSNews has published an `article`__ about some of the issues 
surrounding OS-recreation projects. Further on, it examines two 
platforms and the related re-creation OSes, one of those being AROS 
itself.

The AROS Show has interviewed our project leader Aaron Digulla. Click

Software
--------

*AutoDocReader*, software to read developers' documentation in AutoDoc
format, has been ported to AROS. *AmiGG* 0.44.3 has been ported too, by
Marcin Kielesinski. This is the first Instant Messenger program for AROS
and it supports two protocols popular in Poland: Gadu-Gadu and Tlen.
AmiGG also supports mail notifications. You may find a screenshot
here *(dead link removed)*, while binaries are here *(dead link removed)*.

*Murks!* is an Integrated Development Environment for AROS. Murks! uses 
the same Project File Format that AmiDevCpp uses, so data exchange is 
possible. To use Murks!, you need the AROS native gcc installed on 
your system; Windows users can try Murks! using the latest WinAros 
version containing the native gcc. Full story on AROS-EXEC *(dead link removed)*.
