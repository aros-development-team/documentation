At AmiWest 2012, Samuel Crow and Jason McMullan demonstrated AROS v1 running
on the Sam460ex from `ACube`__, the FPGA Arcade Replay from `FPGA Arcade`__,
and the Raspberry PI from the `Raspberry PI Foundation`__.

Jason McMullan gave a 20 minute `presentation`__ on the origins and current
development of AROS, and was a member of the banquet discussion panel on the
current state and future of the AmigaOS family of operating systems.

At the show, DVDs of `Icaros`__ (pc-i386, ABI v0) and `AROS Vision`__
(amiga-m68k) were given away to all comers.
