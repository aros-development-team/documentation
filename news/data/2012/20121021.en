=============================================
Another (non-calendar-aligned) Year in Review
=============================================

Another year gone by, another year of coding instead of news-writing, 
another selection of highlights.

New web browser
---------------

AROS's usability has made a huge leap with the porting of the modern and 
standards-compliant Odyssey web browser. Based on the WebKit engine, Odyssey 
includes a JIT Javascript compiler, and supports tabbed browsing, HTML5, 
CSS, SVG and SSL. It is also highly configurable, with a GUI allowing 
management of bookmarks, cookies, content blocking, history, passwords and 
more.

Platforms
---------

Support for the ARM architecture has continued to mature and diversify, with 
nightly builds for Linux-hosted AROS versions now available. There is 
particular interest among users in running AROS on the ARM-based Raspberry 
Pi, albeit in Linux-hosted form for now.

There has been further development on other AROS platforms too. The 
Windows-hosted version has seen numerous bug-fixes, and is now a lot more 
stable, while the compatibility of the original Amiga version with legacy 
software continues to improve.

Networking
----------

Wireless networking support has matured, with the addition of two new 
WPA-capable drivers: one is for Realtek RTL8187B-based USB devices, and the 
other is an updated version of the Prism-II driver that first brought 
wireless networking to AROS in 2005. A GUI utility to dynamically scan for 
and connect to wireless networks has also been introduced.

Mobile broadband is now much easier to set up, and additional USB devices 
and phones are also supported. And AROS can now mount SMB share drives, 
although this capability is currently limited to older versions of Windows, 
as well as Linux and standalone NAS devices.

Other improvements
------------------

Initial printing support has been introduced to AROS. Components of the new 
framework include a preferences GUI, a PostScript printer driver and several 
traditional utilities such as PrintFiles and GraphicDump. Output can be 
directed to USB, parallel or serial ports, or to a file.

Our Intel GMA driver has gained 3D support for certain chip revisions. 
Although the GMA hardware has more limited 3D capabilities than 
recent nVidia and AMD cards, many older games (of which many have been 
ported in recent times) still run well. We also gained an OpenGL driver for 
Linux-hosted 3D graphics, and an updated nVidia driver.

The selection of audio drivers available for AROS has improved, with new 
drivers becoming available for ES137x and CMI8738 sound chips. The former is 
significant in that it provides audio output under VMWare.
Our HDAudio driver has also gained wider compatibility in both playback and 
recording modes.

There have been improvements in accessing disks from AROS. We now have an 
AHCI driver that provides native SATA support on many modern machines. In 
addition, standard Windows partitions can now be read using an early version 
of an NTFS filesystem handler, and write speeds to FAT partitions have been 
improved. The newly open-sourced version of the Frying Pan CD-writing 
software is also now a standard AROS component.

Last but not least, our Papercuts initiative led to many small but annoying 
bugs being fixed throughout AROS.

Wider developments
------------------

AROS now has its first distribution for the original (MC680x0) Amiga 
platform, `AROS Vision <http://www.natami-news.de/html/aros_vision.html>`__. 
As well as AROS itself, AROS Vision includes many freely distributable 
third-party AmigaOS system components and applications.

Another new AROS distribution is AEROS *(dead link removed)*, which 
aims to combine the best features of AROS and Linux by integrating them into 
a seamless environment. There are currently versions for x86 and ARM 
systems.
