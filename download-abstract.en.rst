Distributions are pre-configured, and tested, versions of AROS. They
contain a lot of useful 3rd party applications that don't come with the
default AROS.org binaries, and will be of great interest to users.

They often may not have the latest core system components, but should
offer better stability and user-friendliness than the nightly builds. If
you are a user interested in checking what AROS has to offer, you are
highly recommended to use distributions, to get the most complete
AROS experience.
