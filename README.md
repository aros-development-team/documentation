# Documentation

The documentation repository holds the AROS documentation and website source code.


_NB: Changes do not go live until they are pulled into the azure-pipelines branch, however
this is automatically handled for the aros-development-team repository using GitHub actions._


To generate the documentation, or website you must download the AROS sources, and place the
documentation tree inside it, then change to it to generate the files. E.g..

Prepare a build environment -:

    mkdir -p ~/build/aros/www
	git clone https://github.com/aros-development-team/AROS.git ~/build/aros
	git clone https://github.com/aros-development-team/documentation.git ~/build/aros/www
	cd ~/build/aros/www

Now you must build the autodocs,

	./build alldocs

And once that has completed, build your desired target..

    ./build www
