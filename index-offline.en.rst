Introduction
============

The AROS Research Operating System is a lightweight, efficient and flexible
desktop operating system, designed to help you make the most of your
computer. It's an independent, portable and free project, aiming at being
compatible with AmigaOS 3.1 at the API level (like Wine, unlike UAE), while
improving on it in many areas. The source code is available under an open
source license, which allows anyone to freely improve upon it.
