   **If you are a user** wanting to try AROS, please use the links in the
   **Distributions** section to download a fully-featured AROS distribution.
   The nightly builds you will find at the bottom of the page are only meant
   for developers and testers. The nightly builds are not configured to be
   easily used, are not always stable, and they are missing most of the
   applications essential to a regular user experience.

Nightly Builds (ABIv1)
======================

Nightly builds are done, as the name implies, every night, directly
from the Git repository, and they contain the latest code. However,
they have not been tested in any way and may contain bugs. Most of the
time, though, they work just fine. `Download link`__

These builds are based on sources of the new `ABI`__. **They are not 
compatible with existing AROS distributions or with the AROS software
available from The AROS Archives or Aminet.**

Please report bugs you may discover while using these builds through the
`issue tracker`__. For any other necessity, please feel free to contact us
through the `AROSWorld`__ forums.

Nightly Builds (ABIv0)
======================

Because almost all available AROS software and distributions are
for the old ABIv0 ABI, we keep these builds for the i386 platform.

Snapshots (ABIv1)
=================

Snapshots are non-periodic, non-automated builds of AROS. They are done
by developers who can't set up a nightly build for some reason.
`Download link`__

These ports are not unmaintained, so please use the `issue tracker`__ to report
bugs.

Snapshots (ABIv0)
=================

As with the nightly builds we keep a set of snapshots which are based
on sources of the ABIv0 branch on a separate download page. `Download link`__
